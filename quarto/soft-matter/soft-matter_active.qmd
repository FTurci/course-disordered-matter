## Beyond thermal systems


## Life-inspired motion: *run and tumble*
The run-and-tumble model describes the motion of active particles, such as bacteria, that alternate between two types of movement: "runs" (straight-line motion) and "tumbles" (random reorientation). This model captures the behavior of microorganisms like *E. coli*.

### Dynamical rules

1. **Run Phase**:
    During a run, the particle moves in a straight line with constant velocity $v_0$:
    $$
    \mathbf{r}(t + \Delta t) = \mathbf{r}(t) + v_0 \hat{\mathbf{n}}(t) \Delta t
    $$

    where:
    - $\mathbf{r}(t)$ is the position of the particle at time $ t$,
    - $v_0$ is the constant speed,
    - $\hat{\mathbf{n}}(t)$ is the unit vector indicating the direction of motion.

2. **Tumble Phase**:
    During a tumble, the particle randomly reorients. The new direction $\hat{\mathbf{n}}(t)$ is chosen from a uniform distribution over the unit sphere (in 3D) or circle (in 2D).


We can the imagine a schematic algorithm:
    - Initialize the particle's position $\mathbf{r}(0)$ and direction $\hat{\mathbf{n}}(0)$.
    - For each time step $\Delta t$:
        - With probability $\lambda \Delta t$, perform a tumble (randomize $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$).
        - Otherwise, update the position using the run equation.
    - Repeat for the desired simulation duration.

Here, $\lambda$ is the tumble rate, which determines the frequency of reorientation events.

## Coloured noise
Coloured noise introduces temporal correlations into the random forces acting on a particle, unlike white noise, which is uncorrelated. This is often modeled using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the noise term.

In the context of active matter, coloured noise can be used to describe the dynamics of active particles, where the noise term $\boldsymbol{\eta}(t)$ evolves as:
$$
\frac{d\boldsymbol{\eta}(t)}{dt} = -\frac{\boldsymbol{\eta}(t)}{\tau_c} + \sqrt{\frac{2D_c}{\tau_c}} \boldsymbol{\xi}(t),
$$
where:
- $\tau_c$ is the correlation time of the noise,
- $D_c$ is the noise strength,
- $\boldsymbol{\xi}(t)$ is a Gaussian white noise term with zero mean and unit variance.

The particle's velocity $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is then given by:
$$
\mathbf{v}(t) = v_0 \hat{\mathbf{n}}(t) + \boldsymbol{\eta}(t),
$$
where $\hat{\mathbf{n}}(t)$ is the direction of self-propulsion.

The coloured noise description of active matter is a generalisation of the run and tumble dynamics. The run phase corresponds to the persistence of $\hat{\mathbf{n}}(t)$ over time, governed by the correlation time $\tau_c$, whereas the tumble phase is analogous to a rapid decorrelation of $\hat{\mathbf{n}}(t)$, which can be modeled by resetting $\boldsymbol{\eta}(t)$ or introducing a large noise term.


## Active Brownian particle and motility-induced phase separation


Active Brownian particles (ABPs) are a widely studied model in active matter physics. These particles exhibit self-propulsion and are subject to both thermal noise and rotational diffusion, which governs the evolution of their orientation.

The dynamics of an ABP can be described by the following equations:

1. **Translational Motion**:
    The position $\mathbf{r}(t)$ of the particle evolves as:
    $$
    \frac{d\mathbf{r}(t)}{dt} = v_0 \hat{\mathbf{n}}(t) + \sqrt{2D_t} \boldsymbol{\xi}(t),
    $$
    where:
    - $v_0$ is the self-propulsion speed,
    - $\hat{\mathbf{n}}(t)$ is the unit vector indicating the particle's orientation,
    - $D_t$ is the translational diffusion coefficient,
    - $\boldsymbol{\xi}(t)$ is a Gaussian white noise term with zero mean and unit variance.

2. **Rotational Motion**:
    The orientation $\hat{\mathbf{n}}(t)$ undergoes rotational diffusion, described by:
    $$
    \frac{d\hat{\mathbf{n}}(t)}{dt} = \sqrt{2D_r} \boldsymbol{\eta}(t),
    $$
    where:
    - $D_r$ is the rotational diffusion coefficient,
    - $\boldsymbol{\eta}(t)$ is a Gaussian white noise term with zero mean and unit variance.

    In 2D, the orientation $\hat{\mathbf{n}}(t)$ can be expressed in terms of an angle $\theta(t)$:
    $$
    \hat{\mathbf{n}}(t) = (\cos\theta(t), \sin\theta(t)),
    $$
    and the rotational dynamics reduce to:
    $$
    \frac{d\theta(t)}{dt} = \sqrt{2D_r} \eta_\theta(t),
    $$
    where $\eta_\theta(t)$ is a scalar Gaussian white noise term.


ABPs can exhibit a phenomenon known as motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), where particles spontaneously separate into dense and dilute phases due to their self-propulsion. This occurs when the persistence of motion (determined by $v_0$ and $D_r$) and particle interactions lead to clustering.

The key mechanism behind MIPS is the feedback between particle accumulation and reduced motility in dense regions. As particles slow down in crowded areas, they spend more time there, further increasing the local density and promoting phase separation.
