\begin{question}

\begin{itemize}

\item[(a)] What is Brownian motion? \marks{3}

\item[(b)] A dilute suspension of identical spherical colloidal
particles in a liquid of lower density than that of the particles is
allowed to reach (dynamic) equilibrium in the earth's gravitational
field. By equating the downward flux of particles due to sedimentation
across a horizontal plane in the suspension, to the upward flux due to
diffusion, derive the Stokes-Einstein expression for the diffusion
constant of the particles. You may assume the usual expression for the
Stokes drag on a sphere. State any other assumptions made. \marks {7}

\item[(c)] Colloidal particles of radius $R=230\:$nm,
density $1250\:$kg m$^{-3}$ are suspended in water in a sample of
height $100\: \mu$m and have been allowed to reach equilibrium in the
earth's gravitational field. 

\begin{itemize}

\item[(i)] Calculate the `gravitational length' for this suspension. \marks{3}

\item[(ii)] What is the ratio of the concentration at the top of the
sample to the concentration at the bottom. \marks{4}

\item[(iii)] Make a rough estimate of the time it take the sample to
reach equilibrium after it has been shaken up. \marks{3}

(The viscocity of water is $10^{-3}$Pa~s at temperature of $20\:^\circ$C and
its density is $1000\:$kg$\;$m$^{-3}$)

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
\begin{itemize}

\item[(a)]

\begin{itemize}

\item[(i)] Briefly explain the freely-jointed chain model of a polymer
and its underlying assumptions. What does this model predict in the
limit of large degree of polymerisation $N$ for the probability
$P(\underline{R})$ of a particular end-to-end vector $\underline
{R}$, its average $\langle \underline{R}\rangle$, and mean square value
$\langle \underline{R}^2\rangle$? Justify your answer.  \marks{6}

\item[(ii)] Explain in words (rather than equations) what the radius of
gyration describes. Why is it a useful quantity? \marks{3}

\end{itemize}

\item[(b)] Which properties of a real polymer render the freely-jointed
chain model inadequate? Describe how the model can be modified to
provide a more adequate description of a real polymer. Explain the
consequences that these modifications have for $P(\underline{R})$ and
$\langle \underline{R}^2\rangle$. (Long mathematical derivations are
not required, while the use of sketches is encouraged.) \marks{5}

\item[(c)] The length $l$ of a linear hydrocarbon chain with $n$ carbon
atoms is $l_c=(0.154+0.1265n)$ and its volume is given by
$v=(27.4+26.9n)\times 10^{-3}$ nm$^3$.

Consider a surfactant molecule which has an anionic head group, with an
optimum head group area in aqueous solution of $a_0=0.70$ nm$^2$, and a
linear hydrocarbon tail with $n=10$ carbon atoms. 

(i) What shape micelles are formed by the amphiphile molecules.

(ii) What is the average size and aggregation number of each micelle?
