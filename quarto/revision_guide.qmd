In addition to having worked through and being familiar with all the questions on the problem sheets, you are expected to:

- Know the relationship between the free energy of a system and its partition function. Be able to differentiate the free energy to obtain thermodynamic observables and fluctuation relations for the heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility.

- Know the forms of the singularities exhibited by key observables on the approach to criticality and be able to define the exponents $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$ and $\nu$.

- Be able to draw the phase diagrams of magnetic and fluid systems and define the critical exponents. You should know the key differences between first and second order phase transitions.

- Understand the isomorphism between the Ising model and lattice gas.

- **Ising model**: Write down the Hamiltonian of the Ising model and be familiar with its properties in $d = 1, 2, 3$. Derive the Ising model free energy in $d = 1$ both in zero magnetic field (kink method) and in a finite field (Transfer matrix method).

- **Mean field theory**: Show that the effective Hamiltonian 
  $$ H_{\text{eff}} = H + qJm $$
  and derive the equation 
  $$ m = \tanh(\beta H_{\text{eff}}). $$
  From this, find the behaviour of $m$ and $\chi$ near $T_c$. Know the form of the spin-spin correlation function in mean field theory and use it to calculate the behaviour of the heat capacity near criticality. Describe the shortcomings of mean field theory and explain the underlying reasons.

- **Landau theory**: Given the Landau free energy, sketch and interpret the form of the free energy as a function of magnetisation for a range of temperatures around $T_c$. Derive the values of the critical exponents $\beta$, $\delta$, $\gamma$, $\alpha$. Understand the genesis of first order phase transitions and metastability within Landau theory and the importance of symmetry considerations.

- **Scaling theory**: Recast a generalised homogeneous function as a power law in one variable. Applying this to the free energy, deduce scaling forms for key observables and relationships between the scaling variables and the critical exponents. Deduce scaling laws relating the critical exponents. Describe experimental tests of scaling and its utility in the context of computer simulations of critical phenomena.

- **Renormalization Group**: Describe the main purpose and features of the RG formalism in the real-space (block variable) approach. Describe the relevance of the RG to scaling phenomena and universality. Know which essential qualitative features of a system delineate universality classes. 

- **Classical nucleation theory**: Understand that in first-order phase transitions, like in the Ising model under a small external field, or a slightly oversaturated gas, a free energy barrier must be overcome for the stable phase to nucleate within the metastable phase. Describe in qualitative and mathematical terms how nucleation involves the formation of a critical-sized region of the new phase, which can then grow to complete the transition, with the balance between bulk energy gain and surface energy cost determining the critical size. Describe mathematically how growth dynamics after nucleation depend on factors like interface motion and external driving forces, shaping the overall evolution from the metastable to the stable phase.

- **Stochastic processes**: Understand that many natural processes are stochastic, meaning their evolution over time involves inherent randomness, either from lack of microscopic detail (in classical physics) or intrinsic probabilistic nature (in quantum mechanics).  Describe such systems, using coarse-grained probabilistic methods, focusing on the likelihood of different outcomes instead of exact trajectories, ie. the master equation. Derive macroscopic behaviors like diffusion by analyzing the balance of transition rates between states. Understand that the Langevin approach models particle motion using a stochastic differential equation, offering a trajectory-based view complementary to the probability-focused diffusion (Fokker-Planck) equation. Describe mathematically how in the Langevin equation, random forces and friction combine to determine particle displacements over small time intervals, capturing the randomness inherent in Brownian motion. Derive key statistical quantities such as the mean square displacement and the form of the diffusion constant and dampling constant.   By analyzing the statistics of these random steps, one can derive the diffusion equation as the continuum limit of the random walk. 

- **Dynamics of fluctuations**: Understand and describe mathematically how fluctuations of thermodynamic variables, like local magnetization or density, can be analyzed through their time correlations when the system is in thermal equilibrium. Describe the role of the two-time correlation function $M_{xx}(t)$, which measures how a fluctuation at one time is related to a fluctuation at a later time.  Describe how in equilibrium, this correlation depends only on the time difference and typically decays exponentially with a characteristic correlation time $t_c$.
