In most of these (web) pages we have been considering systems implicitly (or explicitly)  in thermal equilibrium with a surrounding environemnt. This is typically some kind of dispersion medium (a solvent). But we also also been more demanding: we have required that the dispersed phase (the colloids, the polymers the anisotropic particles of liquid crystals) have explored exhaustively their free energy options and that they are truly in some macrostate corresponding to a global, stable thermal equilibrium state.

Equilibrium signifies time reversibility.

At equilibrium, the entropy change $\Delta S$ of a system between two times $t_1, t_2$ or equivalently the entropy production $\frac{dS}{dt}$ are **zero**. Hence the transformation between $t_1$ and $t_2$ has to be **reversible**.

Many fluids, whether simple liquids like argon or complex liquids such as colloids and polymers, can be quenched to temperatures well below their equilibrium freezing point without crystallization occurring on experimental timescales. In thermodynamic terms this is interpreted as a failure of the system to reach its true equilibrium (minimum free energy) state, namely the ordered crystalline phase. Such out-of-equilibrium systems are known as glasses. In terms of their structure (eg as measured by a radial distribution function, $g(r)$, they are practically indistinguishable from a liquids, i.e. they exhibit some short ranged order, but no long ranged order. However, their dynamic behaviour is quite different from that of liquids; glasses exhibit very slow relaxation because molecules cannot easily diffuse. As a result, glasses do not flow (on experimental timescales) and therefore their mechanical properties, i.e. their response to stress and shearing, is more akin to that of solids.

### Glass forming systems

Glasses may be formed if the cooling rate is so fast that the liquid does not have time to crystallize , or alternatively because the molecules have some feature to their structure or bonding that inhibits the formation of a crystalline phase. Many glass forming materials are found in nature. Below we describe just a few.

Elements: Sulphur, Selenium and Phosphorous readily form glasses.
Metallic alloys: liquid metals can form glasses if quenched very rapidly ( $10^{6} \mathrm{~K} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ). Such glasses find applications in recording heads and electrical transformers.
Polymer glasses: Due to entanglement effects, polymers form glasses very easily. Examples from everyday life are polycarbonates (eyeglasses, shatterproof windows) and polymethacrylate (plastic pipes and tubes).
Oxide glasses: Familiar examples are $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}, \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and CaO (all components of window glass).
Organic glasses: Sucrose solution forms a glass used in boiled sweets. Toluene and methanol also readily form glasses.

### Relaxation time and viscosity

Let us first consider relaxation in liquids. We have already seen that at high volume fractions a particle is effectively trapped by its nearest neighbours, within a 'cage'. To escape the cage, a particle must jump. Let us now consider the characteristic time $\tau$ between such jumps and its dependence on temperature. Empirically, one finds that

$$
\tau^{-1} \sim v \exp \left(-\frac{\varepsilon}{k_{B} T}\right)
$$

Here $v$ is the typical vibration frequency for a particle rattling around in its cage. This can also be regarded as the frequency with which the particle attempts to escape its cage. The probability of an escape attempt succeeding depends on a Boltzmann factor, i.e. the exponential of the ratio of the energy cost associated with climbing the cage "walls", $\varepsilon$, to the typical thermal energy $k_{B} T$.

It can be shown (cf. PH10002), that the relaxation time $\tau$ is proportional to another quantity, the viscosity $\eta$, which is a measure of the response of a material to a shear stress, or more loosely speaking a measure of the ability of a liquid to flow. Thus $\tau \propto \eta$ and it follows that

$$
\eta=\frac{G_{0}}{v} \exp \left(\frac{\varepsilon}{k_{B} T}\right)
$$

where $G_{0}$ is a proportionality constant. This characteristic exponential temperature dependence is known as Arrhenius behaviour. Loosely speaking the viscosity provides a measure of the ability of a liquid to flow.

While Arrhenius behaviour is observed for the viscosity of liquids at high temperature, things are very different at low temperature. The experimentally measured viscosity and the associated configurational relaxation time exhibits a temperature dependence that strongly departs from that implied by the characteristic frequency of vibrations $v$

$$
\eta=\eta_{0} \exp \left(\frac{B}{T-T_{0}}\right)
$$

The empirical finding, known as the Vogel-Fulcher law implies that the viscosity diverges exponentially at the finite temperature $T_{0}$. In practical terms, this means that as $T_{0}$ is approached from above, one reaches some temperature $T_{g}$ (the glass transition temperature) at which the time for a configuration to relax becomes
comparable to the timescale of the experiment itself $\tau_{\exp }$. At this point, the system falls out of equilibrium with respect to rearrangements of the particle configurations.

### Characterising the glass transition

The glass transition temperature $T_{g}$ is that temperature at which the system falls out of equilibrium on the experimental timescale $\tau_{\text {exp. }}$. Clearly therefore, if one does a long experiment, in which the temperature is lowered slowly, the system will have a greater time to relax at each successive temperature and will stay in equilibrium to a lower temperature. Thus the experimental glass transition temperature depends on the rate at which we do the experiment. To illustrate this consider a measurement of some structural quantity (such as the sample volume) as a function of temperature. Various scenarios for the behaviour of the volume as the temperature are shown in the following figure

At the glass transition temperature, the curve exhibits a well defined discontinuity in it slope, rather like what happens at an equilibrium phase transition such as freezing or boiling. The reason why the glass transition is not a true thermodynamic phase transition is that the temperature at which the discontinuity occurs depends on the history of the sample, i.e. how rapidly it is cooled. We say that the glass transition is a kinetic phase transition brought on by the divergence of the structural relaxation time.

### A simple picture of the glass transition

Theories of the glass transition are a matter of intense current research and it is probably fair to say that the detailed physics is still not well understood in a comprehensive fashion. Nevertheless simple models offer some insight, in qualitative if not quantitative agreement with experiment. One such theory is based on the idea of cooperativity. In a liquid at high temperatures, a molecule can diffuse simply by moving to occupy the space made available by the random local motions of its neighbours. At low temperatures and high volume fractions, the local motion of neighbours is insufficient to allow diffusion. Instead a number of neighbours must move cooperatively in order to make space for a molecule to move. The minimum number of molecules that have to move in unison in order for diffusion of a molecule to take place gives rise to the concept of a cooperative rearranging region. As the temperature is lowered the size of this region increases, diverging (with the viscosity) at the Vogel-Fulcher temperature $T_{0}$

If we suppose that the energy barrier for a single molecule to move is $\mu$ and there are $z$ molecules in the cooperatively rearranging region, then the thermal activation barrier for motion is

$$
\tau^{-1} \sim v \exp \left(-\frac{z \mu}{k_{B} T}\right)
$$

with $v$ the microscopic vibration frequency. Within this model, the non Arrhenius behaviour of the relaxation time (see above) derives from the increase in the number of molecules that have to move cooperatively as temperature decreases, i.e. the $T$ dependence of $z$.
