Welcome to the Complex Disordered Matter Course!

This course introduces your to the theoretical, computational and experimental aspects of the physics of disordered systems.

## Intended learning outcomes

The course will 

- Introduce you to the qualitative features of a range of complex and disordered systems and the experimental techniques used to study them.
- Provide you with elementary computational tools to model complex disordered systems and predict their properties
- Allow you to apply your physics background to understand a variety of **inter-disciplinary** subjects
- Connect with the most recent advances in the research on complex disordered matter.


## Contacts

The course will be taught by

- Prof Nigel B. Wilding (Unit director)
- Dr Francesco Turci
- Dr Adrian Barnes
