    "section": "The 2D Ising model",
    "text": "The 2D Ising model\nThe 2-d spin-\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) Ising model envisages a regular arrangement of magnetic moments or ‘spins’ on an infinite plane. Each spin can take two values, \\(+1\\) (‘up’ spins) or \\(-1\\) (‘down’ spins) and is assumed to interact with its nearest neighbours according to the Hamiltonian\n\\[{\\cal H}_I=-J\\sum_{&lt;ij&gt;}s_is_j - H\\sum_i s_i\n\\label{eq:ising}\\] where \\(J&gt;0\\) measures the strength of the coupling between spins and the sum extends over nearest neighbour spins \\(s_i\\) and \\(s_j\\), i.e it is a sum of the bonds of the lattice. \\(H\\) is a magnetic field term which can be positive or negative (although for the time being we will set it equal to zero). The order parameter is simply the average magnetisation:\n\\[m=\\frac{1}{N} \\langle \\sum_i s_i \\rangle\\:,\\] where \\(\\langle\\cdot\\rangle\\) means an average over configurations.\nThe fact that the Ising model displays a phase transition was argued in sec. 2. Thus at low temperatures for which there is little thermal disorder, there is a preponderance of aligned spins and hence a net spontaneous magnetic moment (ie. the system is ferromagnetic). As the temperature is raised, thermal disorder increases until at a certain temperature \\(T_c\\), entropy drives the system through a continuous phase transition to a disordered spin arrangement with zero net magnetisation (ie. the system is paramagnetic). These trends are visible in configurational snapshots from computer simulations of the 2D Ising model (see fig. 5). Although each spin interacts only with its nearest neighbours, the phase transition occurs due to cooperative effects among a large number of spins. In the neighbourhood of the transition temperature these cooperative effects engender fluctuations that can extend over all length-scales from the lattice spacing up to the correlation length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigurations of the 2d Ising model. The patterns depict typical arrangements of the spins (white=+1, black=−1) generated in a computer simulation of the Ising model on a square lattice of N = 5122 sites, at temperatures of (a) T = 1.2Tc, (b) T = Tc and (c) T = 0.95Tc. In each case only a portion of the system containing 1282 sites in shown. The typical island size is a measure of the correlation length ξ: the excess of black over white (below Tc) is a measure of the order parameter.\n\n\nAn interactive Java based Monte Carlo simulation of the Ising model can be found at\nhttp://www.pha.jhu.edu/ javalab/ising/ising.html (accessible via the Moodle page). By altering the temperature you will be able to observe for yourself how the spin arrangements change as one traverses the critical region. Pay particular attention to the configurations near the critical point. They have very interesting properties. We will return to them later!\nAlthough the 2-d Ising model may appear at first sight to be an excessively simplistic portrayal of a real magnetic system, critical point universality implies that many physical observables such as critical exponents are not materially influenced by the actual nature of the microscopic interactions. The Ising model therefore provides a simple, yet quantitatively accurate representation of the critical properties of a whole range of real magnetic (and indeed fluid) systems. This universal feature of the model is largely responsible for its ubiquity in the field of critical phenomena. We shall explore these ideas in more detail later in the course."

    "section": "Exact solutions: the one dimensional Ising chain",
    "text": "Exact solutions: the one dimensional Ising chain\nOne might well ask why the 2D Ising model is the simplest model to exhibit a phase transition. What about the one-dimensional Ising model (ie. spins on a line)? In fact in one dimension, the Ising model can be solved exactly. It turns out that the system is paramagnetic for all \\(T&gt;0\\), so there is no phase transition at any finite temperature. To see this, consider the ground state of the system in zero external field. This will have all spins aligned the same way (say up), and hence be ferromagnetic. Now consider a configuration with a various “domain walls” dividing spin up and spin down regions:\n\n\n(a) Schematic of an Ising chain at T = 0. (b) At a small finite temperature the chain is split into domains of spins ordered in the same direction. Domains are separated by notional domain “walls”, which cost energy Δ = 2J. Periodic boundary conditions are assumed.\n\n\nInstead of considering the underlying spin configurations, we shall describe the system in terms of the statistics of its domain walls. The energy cost of a wall is \\(\\Delta = 2J\\), independent of position. Domain walls can occupy the bonds of the lattice, of which there are \\(N-1\\). Moreover, the walls are noninteracting, except that you cannot have two of them on the same bond. (Check through these ideas if you are unsure.)\nIn this representation, the partition function involves a count over all possible domain wall arrangements. Since the domain walls are non interacting (eg it doesn’t cost energy for one to move along the chain) we can calculate \\(Z\\) by considering the partition function associated with a single domain wall being present or absent on some given bond, and then simply raise to the power of the number of bonds:\n\\[Z=Z_1^{N-1}\\]\nwhere\n\\[Z_1=e^{\\beta J} + e^{\\beta (J-\\Delta)}=e^{\\beta J}(1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta})\\] is the domain wall partition function for a single bond and represent the sum over the two possible states: domain wall absent or present. Then the free energy per bond of the system is\n\\[\\beta f\\equiv \\beta F/(N-1)=-\\ln Z_1=-\\beta J-\\ln(1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta})\\]\nThe first term on the RHS is simply the energy per spin of the ferromagnetic (ordered) phase, while the second term arises from the free energy of domain walls. Clearly for any finite temperature (ie. for \\(\\beta&lt;\\infty\\)), this second term is finite and negative. Hence the free energy will always be lowered by having a finite concentration of domain walls in the system. Since these domain walls disorder the system, leading to a zero average magnetisation, the 1D system is paramagnetic for all finite temperatures. Exercise: Explain why this argument works only in 1D.\n\nMore general 1D spins systems: transfer matrix method\nGenerally speaking one-dimensional systems lend themselves to a degree of analytic tractability not found in most higher dimensional models. Indeed for the case of a 1-d assembly of \\(N\\) spins each having \\(m\\) discrete energy states, and in the presence of a magnetic field, it is possible to reduce the evaluation of the partition function to the calculation of the eigenvalues of a matrix–the so called transfer matrix.\nLet us start by assuming that the assembly has cyclic boundary conditions, then the total energy of configuration \\(\\{s\\}\\) is\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nH(\\{s\\})=&-\\sum_{i=1}^N (Js_is_{i+1}+Hs_i)\\\\\n\\:=&-\\sum_{i=1}^N (Js_is_{i+1}+H(s_i+s_{i+1})/2)\\\\\n\\:=&\\sum_{i=1}^N E(s_i,s_{i+1})\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwhere we have defined \\(E(s_i,s_{i+1})=-Js_is_{i+1}-H(s_i+s_{i+1})/2\\).\nNow the partition function may be written\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{eq:tm}\nZ_N =& \\sum_{\\{s\\}}\\exp\\left(-\\beta H(\\{s\\})\\right)\\nonumber \\\\\n=&\\sum_{\\{s\\}}\\exp\\left(-\\beta[E(s_1,s_2)+E(s_2,s_3)+....E(s_N,s_1)]\\right) \\nonumber\\\\\n=&\\sum_{\\{s\\}}\\exp\\left(-\\beta E(s_1,s_2)\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\beta E(s_2,s_3)\\right)....\\exp\\left(-\\beta E(s_N,s_1)\\right) \\nonumber\\\\\n=&\\sum_{i,j,...,l=1}^m V_{ij}V_{jk}...V_{li} \\label{eq:Vs}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwhere the \\(V_{ij}=\\exp(-\\beta E_{ij})\\) are elements of an \\(m \\times m\\) matrix \\({\\bf V}\\), known as the transfer matrix (\\(i,j,k\\) etc are dummy indices that run over the matrix elements). You should see that the sum over the product of matrix elements picks up all the terms in the partition function and therefore Eq. [eq:Vs] is an alternative way of writing the partition function.\nThe reason it is useful to transform to a matrix representation is that it transpires that the sum over the product of matrix elements in equation ([eq:Vs]) is simply just the trace of \\({\\bf V}^N\\) (check this yourself for a short periodic chain), given by the sum of its eigenvalues:-\n\\[Z_N=\\lambda_1^N+\\lambda_2^N+...\\lambda_m^N\\] For very large \\(N\\), this expression simplifies further because the largest eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_1\\) dominates the behaviour since \\((\\lambda_2/\\lambda_1)^N\\) vanishes as \\(N\\rightarrow \\infty\\). Consequently in the thermodynamic limit one may put \\(Z_N=\\lambda_1^N\\) and the problem reduces to identifying the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix.\nSpecializing to the case of the simple Ising model in the presence of an applied field \\(H\\), the transfer matrix takes the form\n\\[{\\bf V}(H)=\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\ne^{\\beta(J+H)} & e^{-\\beta J} \\\\\ne^{-\\beta J}   & e^{\\beta(J-H)}\n\\end{array} \\right)\\]\nThis matrix has two eigenvalues which can be readily calculated in the usual fashion as the roots of the characteristic polynomial \\(|{\\bf V}-\\lambda{\\bf I}|\\). They are\n\\[\\lambda_{\\pm}=e^{\\beta J}\\cosh(\\beta H) \\pm \\sqrt{e^{2\\beta J}\\sinh^2\\beta H+e^{-2\\beta J}}.\\]\nHence the free energy per spin \\(f=-k_BT\\ln \\lambda_+\\) is\n\\[f=-k_BT\\ln \\left[e^{\\beta J}\\cosh(\\beta H) + \\sqrt{e^{2\\beta J}\\sinh^2\\beta H+e^{-2\\beta J}}\\right].\\]\nThe Ising model in 2D can also be solved exactly, as was done by Lars Onsager in 1940. The solution is extremely complicated and is regarded as one of the pinnacles of statistical mechanics. In 3D no exact solution is known."

Instead there are a pair of ferromagnetic states (spins mostly up, or spins mostly down) which – by symmetry– have the same free energy, lower than the unmagnetized state."

For \\(T&lt;T_c\\) it is arbitrary which of the two roots \\(\\pm m^\\star\\) is chosen; typically it will be different in different parts of the sample (giving macroscopic “magnetic domains”). But this behaviour with temperature is qualitatively modified by the presence of a field \\(H\\), however small. In that case, there is always a slight magnetization, even far above \\(T_c\\) and the curves becomes smoothed out, as shown. There is no doubt which root will be chosen, and no sudden change of the behaviour (no phase transition).

This may seem counterintuitive, after all at \\(T=0\\) one should expect perfect ordering, not the large fluctuations that accompany criticality. It turns out that the source of the fluctuations that drive the system critical is zero point motion associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Quantum criticality is a matter of ongoing active research, and open questions concern the nature of the phase diagrams and the relationship to superconductivity.

    "section": "Landau theory",
    "text": "Landau theory\nLandau theory is a slightly more general type of mean field theory than that discussed in the previous subsection because it is not based on a particular microscopic model. Its starting point is the Helmholtz free energy, which Landau asserted can be written in terms of a truncated power series expansion of the order parameter. For a ferromagnet this takes the form\n\\[F(m)=F_0+a_2m^2+a_4m^4\n\\label{eq:landau}\\]\nHere only the terms compatible with the order parameter symmetry are included in the expansion. On symmetry grounds, the free energy of a ferromagnet should be invariant under a reversal of the sign of the magnetisation. Terms linear and cubic in \\(m\\) are not invariant under \\(m\\to -m\\), and so do not feature.\nOne can understand how the Landau free energy can give rise to a critical point by plotting its form for various values of \\(a_2\\) with \\(a_4\\) assumed positive (which ensures that the magnetisation remains bounded). This is shown in fig. 11\n\n\nForm of the Landau Free energy for a selection of values of the a2 parameter.\n\n\nThe situation is qualitatively similar to that discussed in sec 5.2. Thermodynamics tells us that the system adopts the state of lowest free energy. Thus from fig. 11, we see that for \\(a_2&gt;0\\), the system will have \\(m=0\\), i.e. will be in the disordered (or paramagnetic) phase. For \\(a_2&lt;0\\), the minimum in the free energy occurs at a finite value of \\(m\\), indicating that the ordered (ferromagnetic) phase is the stable one. In fact, the physical (up-down) spin symmetry built into \\(F\\) indicates that there are two equivalent stable states at \\(m=\\pm m^\\star\\). \\(a_2=0\\) corresponds to the critical point which marks the border between the ordered and disordered phases.\nClearly \\(a_2\\) controls the deviation from the critical temperature, and accordingly we may write\n\\[a_2=\\tilde{a_2} t\\] where \\(t\\) is the reduced temperature.\nWe can now attempt to calculate critical exponents. Restricting ourselves first to the magnetisation exponent \\(\\beta\\) defined by \\(m=t^\\beta\\), we first find the equilibrium magnetisation, corresponding to the minimum of the Landau free energy:\n\\[\\frac{dF}{dm}=2\\tilde{a_2} tm+4a_4m^3=0\n\\label{eq:minimize}\\]\nwhich implies\n\\[m\\propto (-t)^{1/2},\\] so \\(\\beta=1/2\\), which is again a mean field result.\nLikewise we can calculate the effect of a small field \\(H\\) if we sit at the critical temperature \\(T_c\\). Since \\(a_2=0\\), we have\n\\[F(m)=F_0+a_4m^4-Hm\\]\n\\[\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial m}=0 \\Rightarrow m(H,T_c)=\\left(\\frac{H}{4a_4}\\right)^{1/3}\\]\nor\n\\[H \\sim m^\\delta ~~~~~ \\delta=3\\] which defines a second critical exponent.\nNote that at the critical point, a small applied field causes a very big increase in magnetisation; formally, \\((\\partial m/\\partial H)_T\\) is infinite at \\(T=T_c\\).\nA third critical exponent can be defined from the magnetic susceptibility at zero field\n\\[\\chi=\\left(\\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial H}\\right)_{T,V} \\sim |T-T_c|^{-\\gamma}\\]\nExercise: Show that the Landau expansion predicts \\(\\gamma=1\\).\nFinally we define a fourth critical exponent via the variation of the heat capacity (per site or per unit volume) \\(C_H\\), in fixed external field \\(H=0\\):\n\\[C_H \\sim |T-T_c|^{-\\alpha}\\]\nBy convention, \\(\\alpha\\) is defined to be positive for systems where there is a divergence of the heat capacity at the critical point (very often the case). The heat capacity can be calculated from\n\\[C_H =-T\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial T^2}\\]\nFrom the minimization over \\(m\\) (Eq. [eq:minimize], one finds (exercise: check this)\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nF = & 0 ~~~~T&gt;T_c\\nonumber\\\\\nF = & -a_2^2/4a_4 ~~~~ T &lt; T_c\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nUsing the fact that \\(a_2\\) varies linearly with \\(T\\), we have\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nC_H =& 0 ~~~~ T\\to T_c^+\\nonumber\\\\\nC_H =& \\frac{T\\tilde a_2^2}{2a_4} ~~~~ T \\to T_c^-\\:,\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwhich is actually a step discontinuity in specific heat. Since for positive \\(\\alpha\\) the heat capacity is divergent, and for negative \\(\\alpha\\) it is continuous, this behaviour formally corresponds to \\(\\alpha=0\\)"

    "section": "Methodology of the RG",
    "text": "Methodology of the RG\nThe central idea of the renormalisation group (RG) method is a stepwise elimination of the degrees of freedom of the system on successively larger length-scales. To achieve this one introduces a fourth length scale \\(L\\). In contrast to the other three, which characterize the system itself, \\(L\\) characterises the description of the system. It may be thought of as typifying the size of the smallest resolvable detail in a description of the system’s microstructure.\nConsider the Ising model arrangements displayed in fig. 5(a)-(c). These pictures contain all the details of each configuration shown: the resolution length \\(L\\) in this case has its smallest possible value, coinciding with the lattice spacing i.e. \\(L=L_{\\min}\\). In the present context, the most detailed description is not the most useful: the essential signals with which we are concerned are hidden in a noise of relevant detail. A clue to eliminating this noise lies in the nature of the correlation length, i.e. the size of the largest droplets. The explicit form of the small scale microstructure is irrelevant to the behaviour of \\(\\xi\\). The small scale microstructure is the noise. To eliminate it, we simply select a larger value of the resolution length (or ‘coarse-graining’ length) \\(L\\).\nThere are many ways of implementing this coarse-graining procedure. We adopt a simple strategy in which we divide our sample into blocks of side \\(L\\), each of which contains \\(L^d\\) sites, with \\(d\\) the space dimensions . The centres of the blocks define a lattice of points indexed by \\(I=1,2,....,N/L^d\\). We associate with each block lattice point centre, \\(I\\), a coarse-grained or block variable \\(S_I(L)\\) defined as the spatial average of the local variables it contains:\n\\[S_I(L)=L^{-d}\\sum_i^Is_i\n\\label{eq:blkvar}\\] where the sum extends over the \\(L^d\\) sites in the block \\(I\\). The set of coarse grained coordinates \\(\\{S(L)\\}\\) are the basic ingredients of a picture of the system having spatial resolution of order \\(L\\).\nThe coarse graining operation is easily implemented on a computer. In so doing one is faced with the fact that while the underlying Ising spins can only take two possible values, the block variables \\(S_I(L)\\) have \\(L^d+1\\) possible values. Accordingly in displaying the consequences of the blocking procedure, we need a more elaborate colour convention than that used in fig. 5. We will associate with each block a shade of grey drawn from a spectrum ranging from black to white.\n\n\n\nSee text for details\n\n\nThe results of coarse-graining configurations typical of three different temperatures are shown in fig. 15 and fig. 16. Two auxiliary operations are implicit in these results. The first operation is a length scaling: the lattice spacing on each blocked lattice has been scaled to the same size as that of the original lattice, making possible the display of correspondingly larger portions of the physical system. The second operation is a variable scaling: loosely speaking, we have adjusted the scale (‘contrast’) of the block variable so as to match the spectrum of block variable values to the spectrum of shades at our disposal.\nConsider first a system marginally above its critical point at a temperature \\(T\\) chosen so that the correlation length \\(\\xi\\) is approximately 6 lattice spacing units. A typical arrangement (without coarse-graining) is shown in fig. 15(ai). The succeeding figures,  15(aii) and  15(aiii), show the result of coarse-graining with block sizes \\(L=4\\) and \\(L=8\\), respectively. A clear trend is apparent. The coarse-graining amplifies the consequences of the small deviation of \\(T\\) from \\(T_c\\). As \\(L\\) is increased, the ratio of the size of the largest configurational features (\\(\\xi\\)) to the size of the smallest (\\(L\\)) is reduced. The ratio \\(\\xi/L\\) provides a natural measure of how ‘critical’ is a configuration. Thus the coarse-graining operation generates a representation of the system that is effectively less critical the larger the coarse-graining length. The limit point of this trend is the effectively fully disordered arrangement shown in fig. 15(aiii) and in an alternative form in fig. 15(aiv), which shows the limiting distribution of the coarse grained variables, averaged over many realizations of the underlying configurations: the distribution is a Gaussian which is narrow (even more so the larger the \\(L\\) value) and centred on zero. This limit is easily understood. When the system is viewed on a scaled \\(L\\) larger than \\(\\xi\\), the correlated microstructure is no longer explicitly apparent; each coarse-grained variable is essentially independent of the others.\nA similar trend is apparent below the critical point. Fig. 15(bi) show a typical arrangement at a temperature \\(T&lt;T_c\\) such that again \\(\\xi\\) is approximately \\(6\\) lattice spacings. Coarse-graining with \\(L=4\\) and \\(L=8\\) again generates representations which are effectively less critical (figs. 15(bii) and (biii)). This time the coarse-graining smoothes out the microstructure which makes the order incomplete. The limit point of this procedure is a homogeneously ordered arrangement in which the block variables have a random (Gaussian) distribution centred on the order parameter (fig. 15(biv)).\nConsider now the situation at the critical point. Fig. 16(ai) shows a typical arrangement; figs.  16(aii) and (aiii) show the results of coarse-graining with \\(L=4\\) and \\(L=8\\) respectively. Since the \\(\\xi\\) is as large as the system itself the coarse graining does not produce less critical representations of the physical system: each of the figures displays structure over all length scales between the lower limit set by \\(L\\) and the upper limit set by the size of the display itself. A limiting trend is nevertheless apparent. Although the \\(L=4\\) pattern is qualitatively quite different from the pattern of the local variables, the \\(L=4\\) and \\(L=8\\) patterns display qualitatively similar features. These similarities are more profound than is immediately apparent. A statistical analysis of the spectrum of \\(L=4\\) configurations (generated as the local variables evolve in time) show that it is almost identical to that of the \\(L=8\\) configurations (given the block variable scaling). The implication of this limiting behaviour is clear: the patterns formed by the ordering variable at criticality look the same (in a statistical sense) when viewed on all sufficiently large length scales.\n\n\n\nSee text for details\n\n\nLet us summarize. Under the coarse-graining operation there is an evolution or flow of the system’s configuration spectrum. The flow tends to a limit, or fixed point, such that the pattern spectrum does not change under further coarse-graining. These scale-invariant limits have a trivial character for \\(T&gt;T_c\\), (a perfectly disordered arrangement) and \\(T\n&lt; T_c\\), (a perfectly ordered arrangement). The hallmark of the critical point is the existence of a scale-invariant limit which is neither fully ordered nor fully disordered but which possesses structure on all length scales."

We aim to understand how it is that systems that are different microscopically can nevertheless display critical point behaviour which (in certain respects) is quantitatively identical.\nTo obtain initial insight we introduce a spin-1 Ising model in which the spins take on three values (\\(s_i=1,0,-1\\)), in contrast to the two values (\\(s_i=1,-1\\)) of the spin-1/2 Ising model. The two models have properties which are different: for example, \\(T_c\\) for the three-state model is some \\(30\\%\\) lower than that of the two-state model (for the same coupling \\(J\\)). However, there is abundant evidence that the two models have the same universal properties.\nLet us explore what is the same and what is different in the configurations of the two models at criticality. The configurations of the local variables \\(s_i\\) are clearly qualitatively different for the two models. Now consider the coarse-grained configurations (with \\(L=4\\) and \\(L=8\\) respectively) for the three-state model at the critical point. We have already seen that the coarse-graining operation bears the configuration spectrum of the critical two-state Ising model to a non-trivial scale-invariant limit. It is scarcely surprising that the same is true for the three-state model. What is remarkable is that the two limits are the same! This is expressed in fig. 16(iv), which shows the near coincidence of the distribution of block variables (grey-levels) for the two different coarse-graining lengths. Thus the coarse-graining erases the physical differences apparent in configurations where the local behaviour is resolvable, and exposes a profound configurational similarity.\n\nFluid-magnet universality\nLet us now turn to fluid-magnet universality. In a magnet, the relevant configurations are those formed by the coarse-grained magnetisation (the magnetic moment averaged over a block of side \\(L\\)). In a fluid, the relevant configurations are those of the coarse-grained density (the mass averaged over a block if side \\(L\\)) or more precisely, its fluctuation from its macroscopic average (Fig. 17). The patterns in the latter (bubbles of liquid or vapour) may be matched to pattern in the former (microdomains of the magnetisation), given appropriate scaling operations to camouflage the differences between the length scales and the differences between the variable scales.\n\n\n\nSchematic representation of the coarse graining operation via which the universal properties of fluids and magnets may be exposed.\n\n\nThe results is illustrated in Fig. 18.

    "text": "Universality classes\nCoarse graining does not erase all differences between the physical properties of critical systems. Differences in the space dimension \\(d\\) of two critical systems will lead to different universal properties such as critical exponents. Thus, for instance, the critical exponents of the 2D magnet, match those of the 2d fluid, but they are different to those of 3d magnets and fluids.\nIn fact the space dimension is one of a small set of qualitative features of a critical system which are sufficiently deep-seated to survive coarse graining and which together serve to define the system’s universal behaviour, or universality class. The constituents of this set are not all identifiable a priori. They include the number of components \\(n\\) of the order parameter. Up to now, we have only considered order parameters which are scalar (for a fluid the density, for a magnet the magnetisation), for which \\(n=1\\). In some ferromagnets, the order parameter may have components along two axes, or three axes, implying a vector order parameter, with \\(n=2\\) or \\(n=3\\), respectively. It is clear that the order-parameter \\(n\\)-value will be reflected in the nature of the coarse-grained configurations, and thus in the universal observables they imply.\nA third important feature which can change the universality class of a critical system is the range of the interaction potential between its constituent particles. Clearly for the Ising model, interactions between spins are inherently nearest neighbour in character. Most fluids interact via dispersion forces (such as the Lennard-Jones potential) which is also short ranged owing to the \\(r^{-6}\\) attractive interaction. However some systems have much longer ranged interactions. Notable here are systems of charged particles which interact via a Coulomb potential. The long ranged nature of the Coulomb potential (which decays like \\(r^{-1}\\)) means that charged systems often do not have the same critical exponents as the Ising model and fluid."

In what follows we will refer only to the behaviour of a single typical coarse grained variable, which we shall denote \\(S(L)\\). We suppose that \\(t\\) is sufficiently small that \\(\\xi \\gg\nL_\\textrm{ min}\\). Universality and scaling may be expressed in the claim that, for any \\(L\\) and \\(t\\), scale factors \\(a(L)\\) and \\(b(L)\\) may be found such that the probability distribution \\(p(S(L),t)\\) can be written in the form\n\\[p(S(L),t)=b(L)\\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)\n\\label{eq:blocks}\\] where \\(\\tilde{p}\\) is a function unique to a universality class. The role of the scale factors \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is to absorb the basic non-universal scales identified in sec. 9.2. The critical exponents are implicit in the \\(L\\)-dependence of these scale factors. Specifically one finds:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\na(L)&=&a_0L^{1/\\nu} \\\\\nb(L)&=&b_0L^{\\beta/\\nu}\n\\label{eq:scalefacs}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwhere the amplitudes \\(a_0\\) and \\(b_0\\) are system specific (non-universal) constants.\nThese results state that the critical exponents (in the form \\(1/\\nu\\) and \\(\\beta/\\nu\\)) characterize the ways in which the configuration spectrum evolves under coarse-graining. Consider, first the exponent ratio \\(\\beta/\\nu\\). Precisely at the critical point, there is only one way in which the coarse-grained configurations change with \\(L\\): the overall scale of the coarse-grained variable (the black-white contrast in our grey scale representation) is eroded with increasing \\(L\\). Thus the configurations of coarse-graining length \\(L_1\\) match those of a larger coarse-graining length \\(L_2\\) only if the variable scale in the latter configurations is amplified. The required amplification follows from eqns. [eq:blocks] and [eq:scalefacs]: it is\n\\[\\frac{b(L_2)}{b(L_1)}=\\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_1}\\right)^{\\beta/\\nu}\\:.\\] The exponent ratio \\(\\beta/\\nu\\) thus controls the rate at which the scale of the ordering variable decays with increasing coarse-graining length.\nConsider now the exponent \\(1/\\nu\\). For small but non-zero reduced temperature (large but finite \\(\\xi\\)) there is second way in which the configuration spectrum evolves with \\(L\\). As noted previously, coarse graining reduces the ratio of correlation length to coarse-graining length, and results in configurations with a less critical appearance. More precisely, we see from eq. [eq:blocks] that increasing the coarse graining length from \\(L_1\\) to \\(L_2\\) while keeping the reduced temperature constant has the same effect on the configuration spectrum as keeping coarse-graining length constant which amplifying the reduced temperature \\(t\\) by a factor\n\\[\\frac{a(L_2)}{a(L_1)}=\\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_1}\\right)^{1/\\nu}\\:.\\] One may think of the combination \\(a(L)t\\) as a measure of the effective reduced temperature of the physical system viewed with resolution length \\(L\\).

Thus from the definition of an average\n\\[Q(L,t)=\\bar {S}(L,t)=\\int S(L)p(S(L),t)dS(L)\\] where \\(p(S(L))\\) is the probability distribution of \\(S(L)\\).\nMaking use of the representation of eq. [eq:blocks], we then have that\n\\[Q(L,t) = \\int b(L)S(L)\\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)dS(L)\\]\nTo integrate this we need to change the integration variable from \\(S(L)\\) to \\(b(L)S(L)\\). We have \\(d(b(L)S(L))=b(L)dS(L)\\) since \\(b(L)\\) does not fluctuate. Thus\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nQ(L,t)    &=& b^{-1}(L)\\int b(L)S(L)\\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)d(b(L)S(L))\\nonumber\\\\\n       &=& b^{-1}(L)f(a(L)t)\\nonumber\\\\\n       &=& b_0L^{-\\beta/\\nu}f(a_0L^{1/\\nu}t)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwhere \\(f\\) is a universal function (defined as the first moment of \\(\\tilde{p}(x,y)\\) with respect to \\(y\\)).\nThe above results provide a method for determining the critical exponent ratios \\(\\beta/\\nu\\) and \\(1/\\nu\\) via computer simulations of near critical systems. For instance, at the critical point (\\(t=0\\)) and for finite block size, \\(Q(L,0)\\) will not be zero (the \\(T\\) at which Q vanishes for finite \\(L\\) is above the true \\(T_c\\), cf. sec 8.2). However, we know that its value must vanish in the limit of infinite \\(L\\); it does so like\n\\[Q(L,0)=b_0L^{-\\beta/\\nu}f(0)\\equiv Q_0L^{-\\beta/\\nu}\\]\nThus by studying the critical point \\(L\\) dependence of \\(Q\\) we can estimate \\(\\beta/\\nu\\). A similar approach in which we study two block sizes \\(L\\), and tune \\(t\\) separately in each case so that the results for \\(QL^{\\beta/\\nu}\\) are identical provides information on the value of \\(1/\\nu\\)."

    "text": "A simple example\nThis example illustrates how one can perform the RG transformation ([eq:rgt]) directly, without recourse to a ‘sequence of typical configurations’. The calculation involves a very crude approximation which has the advantage that it simplifies the subsequent analysis.\n\n\n\nCoarse graining by decimation. The spins on the original lattice are divided into two sets \\(\\{s^\\prime\\}\\) and \\(\\{\\tilde{s}\\}\\). The \\(\\{s^\\prime\\}\\) spins occupy a lattice whose spacing is twice that of the original. The effective coupling interaction between the \\(\\{s^\\prime\\}\\) spins is obtained by performing the configurational average over the \\(\\{\\tilde{s}\\}\\)\n\n\nConsider an Ising model in two dimensions, with only nearest neighbour interactions as shown in fig. 19. We have divided the spins into two sets, the spins \\(\\{s^\\prime\\}\\) form a square lattice of spacing \\(2\\), the others being denoted by \\(\\{\\tilde{s}\\}\\). One then defines an effective energy function \\({\\cal H^\\prime}\\) for the \\(s^\\prime\\) spins by performing an average over all the possible arrangements of the \\(\\tilde{s}\\) spins\n\\[\\exp(-{\\cal H}^\\prime)=\\sum_{\\{\\tilde {s}\\}} \\exp(-{\\cal H}).\n\\label{eq:decimate}\\]\nThis particular coarse-graining scheme is called ‘decimation’ because a certain fraction (not necessarily one-tenth!) of spins on the lattice is eliminated. This formulation of a new energy function realizes two basic aims of the RG method: the long-distance physics of the ‘original’ system, described by \\({\\cal H}\\), is contained in that of the ‘new’ system, described by \\({\\cal H}^\\prime\\) (indeed the partition functions are the same as one can see by summing both sides over \\(s^\\prime\\)) and the new system is further from critically because the ratio of \\(\\xi\\) to lattice spacing (‘minimum length scale’) has been reduced by a factor of \\(1/2\\) (the ratio of the lattice spacings of the two systems). We must now face the question of how to perform the configuration sum in eq. [eq:decimate]. This cannot in general be done exactly, so we must resort to some approximation scheme. The particular approximation which we invoke is the high temperature series expansion which was touched upon in sec. 7. In its simplest mathematical form, since \\({\\cal H}\\) contains a factor \\(1/k_BT\\), it involves the expansion of \\(\\exp(-{\\cal H})\\) as a power series:\n\\[\\exp(-{\\cal H}/k_BT)=1-{\\cal H}/k_BT +\\frac{1}{2!}({\\cal H}/k_BT)^2+.....\\]\nWe substitute this expansion into the right hand side of eq. [eq:decimate] and proceed to look for terms which depend on the \\(s^\\prime\\) spins after the sum over the possible arrangements of the \\(\\tilde{s}\\) spins is performed. This sum extends over all the possible (\\(\\pm 1\\)) values of all the \\(\\tilde{s}\\) spins. The first term (the 1) in the expansion of the exponential is clearly independent of the values of the \\(s^\\prime\\) spins. The second term (\\({\\cal H}\\)) is a function of the \\(s^\\prime\\) spins, but gives zero when the sum over the \\(s^\\prime\\) spins is performed because only a single factor of any \\(s^\\prime\\) ever appears, and \\(+ 1 - 1 = 0\\). The third term (\\({\\cal H}^2/2\\)) does contribute. If one writes out explicitly the form of \\({\\cal H}^2/2\\) one finds terms of the form \\(K^2s_1^\\prime\\tilde{s}\\tilde{s}s_2^\\prime=K^2s_1^\\prime s_2^\\prime\\), where \\(s_1^\\prime\\) and \\(s_2^\\prime\\) denote two spins at nearest neighbour sites on the lattice of \\(s^\\prime\\) spins and \\(\\tilde{s}\\) is the spin (in the other set) which lies between them. Now, in the corresponding expansion of the left hand side of eq. [eq:decimate], we find terms of the form \\(K^\\prime s_1^\\prime s_2^\\prime\\), where \\(K^\\prime\\) is the nearest neighbour coupling for the \\(s^\\prime\\) spins. We conclude (with a little more thought than we detail here) that\n\\[K^\\prime=K^2\n\\label{eq:rgdec}\\]\nOf course many other terms and couplings are generated by the higher orders of the high temperature expansion and it is necssary to include these if one wishes reliable values for the critical temperature and exponents, However, our aim here is to use this simple calculation to illustrate the RG method. Let us therefore close our eyes, forget about the higher order terms and show how the RGT (eq. [eq:rgdec]) can be used to obtain information on the phase transition.\n\n\n\nCoupling flow under the decimation transformation described in the text.\n\n\nThe first point to note is that that mathematically eq. [eq:rgdec] has the fixed point \\(K^*= 1\\); if \\(K= 1\\) then the new effective coupling \\(K^\\prime\\) has the same value \\(1\\). Further, if \\(K\\) is just larger than \\(1\\), then \\(K^\\prime\\) is larger than \\(K\\), i.e. further away from \\(1\\). Similarly, if \\(K\\) is less than \\(1\\), \\(K^\\prime\\) is less than \\(K\\). We say that the fixed point is unstable: the flow of couplings under repeated iteration of eq. [eq:rgdec] is away from the fixed point, as illustrated in fig. 20. The physical significance of this is as follows: suppose that the original system is at its critical point so that the ratio of \\(\\xi\\) to lattice spacing is infinite. After one application of the decimation transformation, the effective lattice spacing has increased by a factor of two, but this ratio remains infinite; the new system is therefore also at its critical point. Within the approximations inherent in eq. [eq:rgdec], the original system is an Ising model with nearest neighbour coupling \\(K\\) and the new system is an Ising model with nearest neighbour coupling \\(K^\\prime\\). If these two systems are going to be at a common critically, we must identify \\(K^\\prime=\nK\\). The fixed point \\(K^*= 1\\) is therefore a candidate for the critical point \\(K_c\\), where the phase transition occurs. This interpretation is reinforced by considering the case where the original system is close to, but not at, criticality. Then \\(\\xi\\) is finite and the new system is further from critically because the ratio of \\(\\xi\\) to lattice spacing is reduced by a factor of two. This instability of a fixed point to deviations of \\(K\\) from \\(K^*\\) is a further necessary condition for its interpretation as a critical point of the system. In summary then we make the prediction\n\\[K_c=J/k_BT_c=1\n\\label{eq:Kc}\\]\nWe can obtain further information about the behaviour of the system close to its critical point. In order to do so, we rewrite the transformation (eq. [eq:rgdec]) in terms of the deviation of the coupling from its fixed point value. A Taylor expansion of the function \\(K^\\prime=K^2\\) yields\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nK^\\prime &=& (K^*)^2 +(K-K^*)\\left.\\frac{\\partial K^\\prime}{\\partial K}\\right|_{K=K^*}+\\frac{1}{2}(K-K^*)^2\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 K^\\prime}{\\partial K^2}\\right|_{K=K^*}+\\ldots\\nonumber\\\\\nK^\\prime - K^* &=& 2 (K - K^*)+ (K - K^*)^2\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwhere in the second line we have used the fact that the first derivative evaluates to \\(2K^*=2\\) and \\((K^*)^2=K^*\\).\nFor a system sufficiently close to its critical temperature the final term can be neglected. The deviation of the coupling from its fixed point (critical) value is thus bigger for the new system than it is for the old by a factor of two. This means that the reduced temperature is also bigger by a factor of two:\n\\[t^\\prime= 2t\\]\nBut \\(\\xi\\) (in units of the appropriate lattice spacing) is smaller by a factor of \\(1/2\\):\n\\[\\xi^\\prime= \\xi/2\\]\nThus, when we double \\(t\\), we halve \\(\\xi\\), implying that\n\\[\\xi\\propto t^{-1}\\]\nfor \\(T\\) close to \\(T_c\\). Thus we see that the RGT predicts scaling behaviour with calculable critical exponents. In this simple calculation we estimate the critical exponent \\(\\nu=1\\) for the square lattice Ising model. This prediction is actually in agreement with the exactly established value. The agreement is fortuitous- the prediction in Eq. refeq:Kc for \\(K_c\\), is larger than the exactly established value by a factor of more than two. In order to obtain reliable estimates more sophisticated and systematic methods must be used.\nThe crude approximation in the calculation above produced a transformation, eq. [eq:rgdec], involving only the nearest neighbour coupling, with the subsequent advantages of simple algebra. We pay a penalty for this simplicity in two ways: the results obtained for critical properties are in rather poor agreement with accepted values, and we gain no insight into the origin of universality."

    "text": "Universality and scaling\nIn order to expose how universality can arise, we should from the start allow for several different kinds of coupling \\(J_a\\), and show how the systems with different \\(J_a\\) can have the same critical behaviour.\n\n\n\nGeneral flow in coupling space\n\n\nFig. 21 is a representation of the space of all coupling strengths \\(K_a\\) in the energy function \\({\\cal H}/k_BT\\). This is of course actually a space of infinite dimension, but representing three of these, as we have done, enables us to illustrate all the important aspects. First let us be clear what the points in this space represent. Suppose we have some magnetic material which is described by a given set of exchange constants \\(J_1,J_2,J_3.....\\) As the temperature \\(T\\) varies, the coupling strengths \\(K_a=J_a/k_BT\\) trace out a straight line, or ray, from the origin of the space in the direction (\\(J_1,J_2,J_3 ....\\) ). Points on this ray close to the origin represent this magnet at high temperatures, and conversely points far from the origin represent the magnet at low temperatures. The critical point of the magnet is represented by a specific point on this ray, \\(K_a=\nJ_a/k_BT, a= 1,2,\\dots\\) The set of critical points on all of the possible rays forms a surface, the critical surface. Formally, it is defined by the set of all possible models (of the Ising type) which have infinite \\(\\xi\\). It is shown schematically as the shaded surface in fig. 21. (In the figure it is a two-dimensional surface; more generally it has one dimension less than the full coupling constant space, dividing all models into high and low tempera- ture phases.)\nOur immediate goal then is to understand how the RGT can explain why different physical systems near this critical surface have the same behaviour. Let us turn now to the schematic representation of the RG flow in fig. 21. Suppose we start with a physical system, with coupling strengths \\(K_a,  a= 1,2, \\dots\\). What the RGT does is generate a new point in the figure, at the coupling strengths \\(K_a^{(1)}=f_a({\\bf K})\\); these are the couplings appearing in the effective energy function describing the coarse-grained system. If we repeat the transformation, the new energy function has coupling strengths \\(K_a^{(2)}=f_a({\\bf K})\\). Thus repeated application of the transformation generates a flow of points in the figure: \\({\\bf K\\to\nK^{(1)}\\to\\dots\\to K^{(n)}}\\) where the superscript (\\(n\\)) labels the effective couplings after \\(n\\) coarse-graining steps. if the change in coarse-graining scale is \\(b\\) (\\(&gt; 1\\)) at each step, the total change in coarse-graining scale is \\(b^n\\) after \\(n\\) steps. In the process, therefore, the ratio of \\(\\xi\\) to coarse-graining scale is reduced by a factor of \\(b^{-n}\\). The dots in fig. 21 identify three lines of RG flow starting from three systems differing only in their temperature. (The flow lines are schematic but display the essential features revealed in detailed calculations.)\nConsider first the red dots which start from the nearest neighbour Ising model at its critical point. The ratio of \\(\\xi\\) to coarse-graining scale is reduced by a factor b at each step, but, since it starts infinite, it remains infinite after any finite number of steps. In this case we can in principle generate an unbounded number of dots, \\({\\bf K^{(1)}, K^{(2)},\\dots,K^{(n)}}\\), all of which lie in the critical surface. The simplest behaviour of such a sequence as \\(n\\) increases is to tend to a limit, \\(K^*\\), say. In such a case\n\\[K^*_a=f_a(K^*)~~~~ a= 1,2 .....\\]\nThis point \\({\\bf K^*} \\equiv K_1^*, K_2^*, \\dots\\) is therefore a fixed point which lies in the critical surface.\nBy contrast, consider the same magnet as before, now at temperature \\(T\\) just greater than \\(T_c\\), its couplings \\(K_a\\), will be close to the first red dot (in fact they will be slightly smaller) and so will the effective couplings \\(K_a^{(1)},K_2^{(2)},\\dots\\) of the corresponding coarse-grained systems. The new flow will therefore appear initially to follow the red dots towards the same fixed point. However, the flow must eventually move away from the fixed point because each coarse-graining now produces a model further from criticality. The resulting flow is represented schematically by one set of black dots. The other set of black dots shows the expected flow starting from the same magnet slightly below its critical temperature.\nWe are now in a position to understand both universality and scaling within this framework. We will suppose that there exists a single fixed point in the critical surface which sucks in all flows starting from a point in that surface. Then any system at its critical point will exhibit large-length scale physics (large-block spin behaviour) described by the single set of fixed point coupling constants. The uniqueness of this limiting set of coupling constants is the essence of critical point universality. It is, of course, the algebraic counterpart of the unique limiting spectrum of coarse-grained configurations, discussed in sec 9.5. Similarly the scale-invariance of the critical point configuration spectrum (viewed on large enough length scales) is expressed in the invariance of the couplings under iteration of the transformation (after a number of iterations large enough to secure convergence to the fixed point).\nTo understand the behaviour of systems near but not precisely at critically we must make a further assumption (again widely justified by explicit studies). The flow line stemming from any such system will, we have argued, be borne towards the fixed point before ultimately deviating from it after a number of iterations large enough to expose the system’s noncritical character. We assume that (as indicated schematically in the streams of red and blue lines in fig. 21) the deviations lie along a single line through the fixed point, the direction followed along this line differing according to the sign of the temperature deviation \\(T-T_c\\). Since any two sets of coupling constants on the line (on the same side of the fixed point) are related by a suitable coarse-graining operation, this picture implies that the large-length-scale physics of all near- critical systems differs only in the matter of a length scale. This is the essence of near-critical point universality.\nPhase transitions: Problems\nAlthough you should try all of these questions, some of them are deliberately quite challenging. If you don’t get very far with some, don’t worry. We’ll be going over them in problems classes, so you can just regard them as worked examples.\n\nExistence of a phase transition in \\(d=2\\).\n(Straightforward) In lectures it was argued that no long ranged order occurs at finite-temperatures in a one dimensional system because of the presence of domain walls. Were macroscopic domain walls to exist in two dimensions at finite temperature, they would similarly destroy long ranged order and prevent a phase transition. By calculating the free energy of a 2D domain wall for an Ising lattice, show that domain walls do not in fact exist for sufficiently low \\(T\\).\n(Hint: Model the domain wall as a non-reversing \\(N\\)-step random walk on the lattice and find an expression for its energy and -from the number of random walk configurations- its entropy.)\nCorrelation Length\n(Challenging) For a 1D Ising model, show that the correlation between the spins at sites \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), is\n\\[\\langle s_i s_j\\rangle =\\sum_m p_m(-1)^m\\] where \\(m\\) is the number of domain walls between \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) and \\(p_m\\) is the probability of finding \\(m\\) domain walls between them.\nHence show that when \\(R_{ij}=|i-j|a\\) is large (with \\(a\\) the lattice spacing) and the temperature is small, that\n\\[\\langle s_i s_j\\rangle =\\exp(-R_{ij}/\\xi)\\] with \\(\\xi=a/2p\\) and \\(p\\) the probability of finding a domain wall on a bond.\nHint: In the second part note that \\(p_m\\) is given by a binomial distribution because there is a probability \\(p\\) of each bond containing a domain wall and \\((1-p)\\) that it doesn’t. What special type of distribution does \\(p_m\\) tend to when \\(p\\) is small (as occurs at low \\(T\\))?\nA model fluid\n(Straightforward) The van der Waals (vdW) equation of state (recall PH10002) is essentially a mean field theory for fluids. It relates the pressure and the volume of a fluid to the temperature:\n\\[\\left(P+\\frac{a}{V^2}\\right)(V-b)=N_Ak_BT\\] where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are constants and \\(N_A\\) is Avogadro’s number.\nThe critical point of a fluid corresponds to the point at which the isothermal compressibility diverges, that is\n\\[\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V}\\right)_T=0\\] Additionally, one finds that isotherms of \\(P\\) versus \\(V\\) exhibit a point of inflection at the critical point, that is\n\\[\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial V^2}\\right)_T=0\\]\n\nUse these two requirements to show that the critical point of the vdW fluid is located at\n\\[V_c=3b, ~~~ P_c=\\frac{a}{27b^2},~~~ N_AK_BT_c=\\frac{8a}{27b}\\]\nHence show that when written in terms of reduced variables\n\\[p=\\frac{P}{P_c}, ~~~~ v=\\frac{V}{V_c} ~~~~ t=\\frac{T}{T_c}\\]\nthe equation takes the form\n\\[\\left(p+\\frac{3}{v^2}\\right)(v-\\frac{1}{3})=\\frac{8t}{3}\\]\nUse a graph-plotting program such as “Excel” to plot a selection of isotherms close to the critical temperature (you will need to choose suitable units for your axes). Plot also the gradient and second derivative of P vs V on the critical isotherm and confirm numerically that it exhibits a point of inflection at the critical pressure and temperature.\nObtain the value of the critical exponent \\(\\gamma\\) of the vdW model and confirm that it takes a mean-field value.\n\nMean field theory of the Ising model heat capacity\n(Straightforward) Using results derived in lectures, obtain an expression for the mean energy \\(\\langle E\\rangle\\) of the Ising model in zero field, within the simplest mean field approximation \\(\\langle\n  s_is_j\\rangle=\\langle s_i\\rangle\\langle s_j\\rangle=m^2\\). Hence show that for \\(H=0\\) the heat capacity \\(\\partial \\langle\n  E\\rangle/\\partial T\\) has the behaviour\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nC_H=& 0 ~~~~ T&gt;T_c\\\\\nC_H=& 3Nk_B/2 ~~~~ T\\le T_c\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nMagnetisation and fluctuations\n(Slightly tricky) A system of spins on a lattice, has, in the absence of an applied field, a Hamiltonian \\({\\cal H}\\). In the presence of a field \\(h\\) the Hamiltonian becomes \\[\\tilde {\\cal H}={\\cal H}-hM\\] where \\(M\\) is the total magnetisation and \\(h\\) is the magnetic field. By considering the partition function \\(Z(T,h)\\) and its relationship to the free energy \\(F\\) show that in general\n\\[\\langle M \\rangle=-\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial h}\\right)_T\\]\nShow also that the variance of the magnetisation fluctuations is\n\\[\\langle M^2\\rangle-\\langle M\\rangle^2=-k_BT\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial h^2}\\right)_T\\]\n(Hint: This is an important standard derivation found in many text books on Statistical Mechanics. You will need to differentiate \\(F\\) (twice) and use the product and chain rules.)\nSpin-1 Ising model\n(Straightforward) A set of spins on a lattice of coordination number \\(q\\) can take values \\((-1,0,1)\\), as opposed to just \\((-1,1)\\) as in the spin-1/2 Ising model. The Hamiltonian is\n\\[{\\cal H}=-J\\sum_{&lt;ij&gt;}s_is_j + h\\sum_i s_i\\]\nFind the partition function and hence show that in the mean field approximation, the magnetisation per site obeys\n\\[m=\\frac{2\\sinh[\\beta(Jqm+h)]}{2\\cosh[\\beta(Jqm+h)]+1}\\]\nand find the critical temperature \\(T_c\\) at which the net magnetisation vanishes.\nTransfer Matrix.\n(Straightforward strategy but some lengthy algebra required)\nVerify the calculation of the free energy of the 1D periodic chain Ising model in a field outlined in lectures using the Transfer Matrix method.\nUse your results to show that the spontaneous magnetisation is:\n\\[m=\\frac{\\sinh \\beta H}{\\sqrt{\\sinh^2\\beta H+\\exp{-4\\beta J}}}\\] Comment on the value of \\(m\\) in zero field.\n(Hint: Follow the prescription given in lectures. Depending on your approach you may need to use the trigonometrical identities \\(\\cosh^2x-\\sinh^2x=1\\), \\(\\cosh(2x)=2\\cosh^2x-1\\).)\nLattice gas model (Straightforward). Check the claim, made in lectures that the “Hamiltonian” of the Lattice Gas model in the grand canonical ensemble\n\\[{\\cal H}_{LG}=-\\epsilon\\sum_{&lt;i,j&gt;}c_ic_j -\\mu\\sum_ic_i\\]\nis transformed to that of the Ising model by means of the change of variable\n\\[s_i=2c_i-1;~~~~ J=\\frac{\\epsilon}{4}~~~~\nh=\\frac{\\epsilon q+2\\mu}{4}\\]\n(Hint: Note that when doing sums over bonds \\(\\sum_{\\langle\n    i,j\\rangle}\\) for a lattice of coordination \\(q\\) there are \\(q/2\\) bonds per site since each bond is shared between two sites.)\nLandau theory\nCheck and complete the Landau theory calculations, given in lectures, for the critical exponents \\(\\gamma=1\\) and \\(\\alpha=0\\) of the Ising model. For the latter, you should first prove the result\n\\[C_H =-T\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial T^2}\\] starting from the classical theormodynamics expression for changes in the free energy of a magnet \\(dF=-SdT-MdH\\).\n(Hint: If you get stuck with the proof see standard thermodynamics text books. To get the susceptibility exponent in Landau theory add a term \\(-Hm\\) to the Hamiltonian.)\nScaling laws\n(Straightforward.)Using the generalised homogeneous form for the free energy given in lectures, take appropriate derivatives to find the relationships to the critical exponents:\n\\[\\beta=\\frac{1-b}{a}; ~~ \\gamma=\\frac{2b-1}{a};~~ \\delta= \\frac{b}{1-b}; ~~~ \\alpha=2-\\frac{1}{a}.\\]\nHence derive the scaling laws among the critical exponents:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\alpha+\\beta(\\delta+1)=2 \\\\\n\\alpha+2\\beta+\\gamma=2\\\\\n%\\gamma=\\beta(\\delta-1)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n(Hint: For the heat capacity exponent \\(\\alpha\\) use the result from problem 9: \\(C_H=-T\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial T^2}\\right)_{h=0}\\))\nRenormalization Group transformation for the 1D Ising model\n(Challenging.) Consider a 1D Ising model of \\(N\\) spins in zero field given by the Hamiltonian\n\\[{\\cal H}_I/k_BT=-K\\sum_{&lt;ij&gt;}s_is_j -\\sum_iC\\] where a background term is included because even if set zero initially, it will be generated by an RG transformation.\n\nA renormalisation is to be implemented with a scale factor \\(b=2\\). By partially performing the sum in the partition function over the spins on the even numbered lattice sites, show that the partially summed partition function can be written\n\\[Z=\\sum_{s_1,s_3,s_5...}\\prod_{i=2,4,6...} [\\exp\n[K(s_{i-1}+s_{i+1})+2C] + \\exp[-K(s_{i-1}+s_{i+1})+2C]\\]\nNext, relabel the remaining (odd numbered) spins so that they are numbered consecutively eg by an index \\(j\\) (this is a matter of convenience only). Then cast this partially summed partition function in a form that makes it look the same as that for an Ising model with \\(N/2\\) spins. i.e. require that \\(Z^\\prime\\) has the form\n\\[Z=\\sum_{\\{s\\}}\\prod_{j=1}^{N/2}\\exp[K^\\prime s_js_{j+1}+C^\\prime]\\:,\\] for all \\(s_j,s_{j+1}=\\pm 1\\).\nHence show that the effective coupling \\(K^\\prime\\), and background constant \\(C^\\prime\\) of the renormalised system are related to those of the underlying Hamiltonian by\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\exp(K^\\prime+C^\\prime) &=& \\exp(2C)[\\exp(2K)+\\exp(-2K)] \\\\\n\\exp(-K^\\prime+C^\\prime) &=& 2\\exp(2C)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nUse these results to show that the effective coupling flows under the renormalization according to:\n\\[K^\\prime = (1/2)\\ln (\\cosh 2K)\\]\nDoes this flow drive the effective coupling to the low or high temperature fixed point?\nFinally show that the partition function transforms under the RG as\n\\[Z(K,N)=2^{N/2}\\exp(NK^\\prime/2)Z(K^\\prime,N/2)\\]\n\nNote. The above is a hard question, which we’ll go over this in detail in a problems class. So if you don’t make much progress, don’t worry, just treat it as a worked example.\nRG flow of the free energy\n(Straightforward) An alternative RG equation for the effective coupling in the 1D Ising model is\n\\[K = (1/2)\\cosh^{-1}(\\exp 2K^\\prime)\\] which is the inverse of the transformation found in the previous question. This transformation thus drives the system from small effective coupling (high temperature) to high effective coupling (low temperature).\nUnder the transformation, the free energy density transforms like\n\\[\\beta f(K)=(1/2)\\beta f(K^\\prime)-(1/2)\\ln 2-K^\\prime/2\\:.\\]\n\nUse these findings to iteratively calculate the free energy density of the Ising model at low temperatures, starting from the high temperature limit.\nHint: Start with a very low coupling eg. \\(K^\\prime=0.01\\), and show that because interactions between spins are negligible, \\(\\beta f(K^\\prime)\\approx\n-\\ln 2\\). Then iterate the RG equations above \\(8\\) or so times to generate a sequence of \\(K\\) and \\(\\beta f(K)\\) values.\nCompare your results for each iteration with the exact results for the free energy density of the 1D Ising model obtained in lectures."
