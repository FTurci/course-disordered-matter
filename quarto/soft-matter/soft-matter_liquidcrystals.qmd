Ordered phases of matter are typically characterised by spatial correlations, which can be **positional** or **orientational** in nature. 

Positional order is the regular arrangement of particle positions in space, often forming a repeating lattice structure. Orientational order refers to the angular alignment of the neighbours of a particle, influenced for example by the anisotropy of the particle itself (e.g. rods tending to align with other rods).

In crystalline phases, both positional and orientational order are long-ranged, meaning that the arrangement and orientation of particles are correlated over macroscopic distances. In contrast, simple liquids exhibit only very short-range (positional and orientational) correlations. 

Liquid crystals represent an intermediate case, where orientational order can persist over long distances while positional order remains short-ranged or absent.

## Anistropic particles

The decoupling between orientational and translational degrees of freedom is favoured by individual microscopic units (particles) that already have preferntial axis of symmetry, i.e. anisotropic particles. Anisotropic particles have shapes that are not spherically symmetric, such as rods, ellipsoids, or plates. Their interactions depend not only on the distance between particles but also on their relative orientations. 

There are many kinds of anisotropic particles. The table below contains a non-exhaustive list.

## Liquid crystal phases

The additional orientational degrees of freedom makes opens up the possibilities of phases that do not normally exist for spherical, isotropic particles.  We progress from the most disordered to the most ordered phase:

- **Isotropic fluid**: this phase is not very different from the ordinary fluid phase of spherical particles. There is no long-range positional or orientational order and all correlations decay rapidly and on short lengthscales.
- **Nematic phase**: still without translational order, the constituents arrange themselves spontaneously in a preferential, average direction, called the **director**. Since there is no positional order, the transition from isotropic to nematic can only be detected by taking into account the *relative orientations* between the constituents, as the individual centres of mass are as disordered in the nematic as they are in the isotropic. If the particles are themselves chiral (i.e., the particle differs from its mirror image) the director tends to form a helix due to the propensity of te molecules to align at some angle between each other. This leads to so called chiral nematic phase (also known as **cholesteric**).
- **smectic phase**: in this phase, particles not only align along a common direction (as in the nematic phase) but also exhibit partial translational order. The centers of mass of the particles tend to form well-defined layers, with orientational order within each layer. However, within a layer, the positions of the particles remain disordered, similar to a liquid. Smectic phases can be further classified (e.g., smectic A, smectic C) depending on the relative orientation of the director with respect to the layer normal.
- **Columnar phase**: here, anisotropic particles (often disc-like) stack into columns, which then arrange themselves into a two-dimensional lattice. There is long-range positional order in two directions (within the plane perpendicular to the columns) and orientational order along the column axis.
- **Crystal**: the most ordered phase, where both positional and orientational order are long-ranged in all directions, forming a true three-dimensional periodic lattice.


| **Phase**           | **Positional Order**      | **Orientational Order**      |
|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Isotropic fluid     | No                       | No                           |
| Nematic             | No                       | Yes (long-range)         |
| Chiral nematic      | No                       | Yes (helical)            |
| Smectic             | Yes (1D: layered)        | Yes (within layers)      |
| Columnar            | Yes (2D: columns)        | Yes (along columns)      |
| Crystal             | Yes (3D: lattice)        | Yes (long-range)         |

## Orientational correlations and the isotropic/nematic transition

While for the spherical colloids we focused on positional correlation functions like the radial distribution function, for anistropic particle we need to quantify orientational correlations.

Suppose we have $N$ rod-like particles, each with an orientation angle $\theta_i$ (in 2D) or a unit vector $\mathbf{u}_i$ (in 3D). We want to determine the director, i.e. the average direction of the long molecular axes of all molecules in the liquid crystal.

The rods are head-tail symmetric, so, we cannot truly distinguish which one is the head or the tail (e.g. an orientation of $\  theta$ in 2D is the same as an orientation of $\theta+\pi$). We cannot therefore just take the average of the vectors to extract the common orientation of the various vectors, otherwise we would incur into a cancellation.

Instead, we construct a second moment tensor called the **alignment tensor**

$$
\mathbf{Q}=\dfrac{d}{2}\left\langle\mathbf{u}_i \otimes \mathbf{n}_i-\dfrac{1}{d}\mathbf{I}\right\rangle
$$
where $d$ is the dimensionality. The removed $\dfrac{1}{d}\mathbf{I}$ term ensures that the tensor is traceless and does not include istropic components.

The analysis of the tensor yield the main characteristics of the orientation of teh system:
- the largest eigenvalue of $\mathbf{Q}$ is the **scalar nematic order parameter** $S$
- the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalues is called the **director** $\mathbf{n}$ and corresponds to the main collective orientation of the system.

In two dimensions, the director is simply characterised by the angle $\psi$  expressed as 
$$
\psi = \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{atan2}(\sin{2\theta_i}, \cos{2\theta_i}).
$$
and the nematic order parameter is simply

$$
S=\sqrt{\left\langle\cos 2 \theta_i\right\rangle^2+\left\langle\sin 2 \theta_i\right\rangle^2}
$$

while in three dimensions this gives 
$$
S=\dfrac{1}{2} \left\langle\cos ^2 \theta_i-1\right\rangle
$$
(the expression for the director in 3d requires explicit diagonalisation).

# Derivation of 2D director

In two dimensions, each particle has an orientation unit vector

$$
\mathbf{u}_i = \begin{pmatrix} \cos \theta_i \\ \sin \theta_i \end{pmatrix},
$$

and the alignment tensor is defined as

$$
\mathbf{Q} = \left\langle \mathbf{u}_i \otimes \mathbf{u}_i \right\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}
\langle \cos^2 \theta_i \rangle & \langle \cos \theta_i \sin \theta_i \rangle \\
\langle \cos \theta_i \sin \theta_i \rangle & \langle \sin^2 \theta_i \rangle
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Using double-angle trigonometric identities,

$$
\cos^2 \theta = \frac{1 + \cos 2\theta}{2}, \quad \sin^2 \theta = \frac{1 - \cos 2\theta}{2}, \quad \cos \theta \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \sin 2\theta,
$$

we rewrite $\mathbf{Q}$ as

$$
\mathbf{Q} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix}
1 + C & D \\
D & 1 - C
\end{pmatrix},
$$

where

$$
C = \langle \cos 2\theta_i \rangle, \quad D = \langle \sin 2\theta_i \rangle.
$$

To find the eigenvalues $\lambda$, solve

$$
\det(\mathbf{Q} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = 0,
$$

which yields the largest eigenvalue

$$
\lambda_{\max} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{S}{2},
$$

with the scalar nematic order parameter

$$
S = \sqrt{C^2 + D^2}.
$$

Where $S \to 1$ indicates strong alignment and $S \to 0$ indicates isotropic order.

The director $\mathbf{n}$ is the eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda_{\max}$, satisfying

$$
(\mathbf{Q} - \lambda_{\max} \mathbf{I}) \mathbf{v} = 0,
$$

which gives

$$
\mathbf{Q} - \lambda_{\max} \mathbf{I} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix}
C - S & D \\
D & -C - S
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

The eigenvector is

$$
\mathbf{v} \propto \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{S - C}{D} \end{pmatrix}.
$$

Normalizing $\mathbf{v}$ gives the director $\mathbf{n}$.


The director angle $\psi$ is given by

$$
\tan \psi = \frac{S - C}{D}.
$$

This simplifies to

$$
\tan \psi = \frac{D}{S + C}.
$$

Using the double-angle formula,

$$
\psi = \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{atan2}(D, C).
$$

This $\psi$ represents the director’s orientation modulo $\pi$.

### Lattice model: the Lebwohl-Lasher model

The Lebwohl-Lasher model is a lattice model designed to capture the orientational ordering of anisotropic particles, such as those found in nematic liquid crystals and is a lattice version of the Maier-Saupe mean field model. In this model, each lattice site $i$ is associated with a unit vector $\mathbf{n}_i$ representing the local orientation (the "director") of a particle at that site.

The Hamiltonian of the Lebwohl-Lasher model is given by:

$$
H = -\epsilon \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} \left[ \frac{3}{2} (\mathbf{n}_i \cdot \mathbf{n}_j)^2 - \frac{1}{2} \right]
$$

where:
- $\epsilon > 0$ is the coupling constant favoring alignment,
- the sum $\langle i, j \rangle$ runs over all pairs of nearest-neighbor sites,
- $(\mathbf{n}_i \cdot \mathbf{n}_j)^2$ measures the degree of alignment between neighboring directors.

This Hamiltonian favors parallel (or antiparallel) alignment of neighboring directors, capturing the essential physics of the isotropic-nematic transition in liquid crystals.

In two dimensions, the Lebwohl-Lasher model is similarly defined, but the directors $\mathbf{n}_i$ are restricted to lie in the plane. Each director can be represented by a unit vector $\mathbf{n}_i = (\cos\theta_i, \sin\theta_i)$, where $\theta_i$ is the orientation angle at site $i$.

The Hamiltonian in 2D becomes:

$$
H = -\epsilon \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} \left[ \frac{3}{2} \cos^2(\theta_i - \theta_j) - \frac{1}{2} \right]
$$

where the sum is over nearest-neighbor pairs on a 2D lattice. This model captures the essential features of orientational ordering and the isotropic-nematic transition in two-dimensional systems.

## Activity

Modify the script above to check the following 

1.  The high temperature regime ($T\gg 0.5$$) is mostly disordered (isotropic)
2.  The low temperature regime forms larger and larger patches with coherent orientations
3. Define and plot a global nematic order parameter. Τhe global nematic order parameter S is defined as:

$$ S = \langle \cos(2(\theta - \psi))\rangle$$ where $\psi$ is the director (average orientation), which in 2D is

$$\psi = \dfrac{1}{2} {\rm atan2}(\langle \sin(2\theta)\rangle, \langle \cos(2\theta)\rangle)$$
