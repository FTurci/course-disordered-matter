\section*{Overview}\label{overview}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Overview}

\markright{Overview}

This course introduces your to the theoretical, computational and
experimental aspects of the physics of complex disordered matter.

Complex disordered matter is the study of wide range of systems like
\textbf{polymers}, \textbf{colloids}, \textbf{glasses}, \textbf{gels},
and \textbf{emulsions}, which lack long-range order but exhibit
intricate behaviour. Colloids, suspensions of microscopic particles in a
fluid, are useful for studying disordered structures due to their
observable dynamics. Similarly, polymer systems can form amorphous
solids or glasses when densely packed or cooled, showing solid-like
rigidity despite their disordered structure. These materials often
undergo phase transitions, such as demixing and crystallisation, and
near these transitions, they can display critical phenomena with
extensive fluctuations and correlations.

These various are examples of \textbf{soft matter}. systems In soft
matter systems, the interplay between disorder, softness, and phase
behavior leads to rich physical phenomena, particularly near critical
points where even small changes in external conditions can trigger
large-scale reorganizations and universal behaviour. Glasses, for
instance, exhibit slow relaxation and memory effects, while colloidal
systems may crystallize, phase separate, or become jammed depending on
particle interactions and concentration. Understanding such behaviors
involves studying how microscopic interactions and thermal fluctuations
influence macroscopic properties, especially in non-equilibrium
conditions. Through techniques like scattering, microscopy, rheology,
and simulation, one can explore how disordered soft materials respond to
stress, age, or undergo transitions---insights that are vital for
applications in materials design, biotechnology, and beyond.

This course is organized into three interconnected parts, each offering
a distinct perspective on the study of complex disordered matter.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Part 1: Unifying concepts} (Nigel Wilding) introduces the
  theoretical framework for rationalising complex disordered matter
  which is grounded in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. We
  emphasize the theory of phase transitions, thermal fluctuations,
  critical phenomena, and stochastic dynamics---providing the essential
  theoretical tools needed to describe and predict the behavior of soft
  and disordered systems.\\
\item
  \textbf{Part 2: Complex disordered matter} (Francesco Turci) explores
  the phenomenology of key examples of complex disordered soft matter
  systems, including colloids, polymers, liquid crystals, glasses, gels,
  and active matter. These systems will be analyzed using the
  theoretical concepts introduced in Part 1, highlighting how disorder,
  interactions, and fluctuations shape their macroscopic behavior.\\
\item
  \textbf{Part 3: Experimental techniques} (Adrian Barnes) focuses on
  the methods of microscopy, and scattering via x-rays, neutrons and
  light that are used to study complex disordered matter, offering
  insight into how their properties are measured and understood in
  real-world contexts.
\end{itemize}

In addition to theory and experiment, computer simulation plays a
central role in soft matter research. This course includes a substantial
coursework component consisting of two computational projects. These
exercises will allow you to apply state-of-the-art simulation techniques
to investigate the complex behavior of disordered systems, bridging
theory and observation through hands-on exploration.

\chapter{Introduction to phase behaviour and enhanced
fluctuations}\label{introduction-to-phase-behaviour-and-enhanced-fluctuations}

A phase transition can be defined as a macroscopic rearrangment of the
internal constituents of a system in response to a change in the
thermodynamic conditions to which they are subject. A wide variety of
physical systems undergo such transitions. Understanding the properties
of phase transitions is fundamental to the study of soft and complex
matter, as these systems often exhibit rich and subtle transformations
between different states of organization. Whether in colloidal
suspensions, polymer blends, liquid crystals, or biological materials,
phase transitions underpin a wide range of physical behaviours, from
self-assembly and pattern formation to critical phenomena and dynamical
arrest. By analysing how macroscopic phases emerge from microscopic
interactions and external conditions, one gains crucial insight into the
principles that govern structure, stability, and functionality in these
intricate systems. As such, an understanding of phase transitions not
only enriches theoretical understanding but also informs practical
applications across materials science, biophysics, and nanotechnology.
For these reasons we will devote a large proportion of this course to
the study of phase transitions.

Two classic examples of systems displaying phase transitions are the
ferromagnet and fluid systems. For the magnet, a key observable is the
magnetisation defined as the magnetic moment per spin, given by
\(m=M/N\), with \(N\) the number of spins. \(m\) can be positive or
negative, dependent on whether the spins are aligned `up' or `down'. As
the temperature of a ferromagnet is increased, its net magnetisation
\(|m|\) is observed to decrease smoothly, until at a certain temperature
known as the critical temperature, \(T_c\), it vanishes altogether (see
left part of Figure~\ref{fig-isingpd}). We define the magnetisation to
be the \emph{order parameter} of this phase transition.

One can also envisage applying a magnetic field \(H\) to the system
which, depending on its sign (i.e.~whether it is aligned (positive) or
anti-aligned (negative) relative to the magnetisation axis), favours up
or down spin states respectively, as shown schematically in
Figure~\ref{fig-isingpd} (right part). Changing the sign of the magnetic
field \(H\) for \(T<T_c\) leads to a phase transition chacterised by a
discontinuous jump in \(m\). We shall explore this behaviour in more
detail in \textbf{?@sec-meanfield}.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{phase-transitions/Figs/isingpd_color.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-isingpd}Phase diagram of a simple magnet
(schematic). Left: magnetisation as a function of temperature for zero
applied magnetic field, \(H=0\). Right: Applying a magnetic field that
is aligned or antialigned with the direction of the magnetisation leads
to a phase transition. The \(H=0\) axis at \(T<T_c\) is the coexistence
curve for which positive and negative magnetisations are equally
likely.}

\end{figure}%

Similarly, a change of state from liquid to gas can be induced in a
fluid system (though not in an ideal gas) simply by raising the
temperature. Typically the liquid-vapour transition is abrupt,
reflecting the large number density difference between the states either
side of the transition. However the abruptness of this transition can be
reduced by applying pressure. At one particular pressure and temperature
the discontinuity in the density difference between the two states
vanishes and the two phases coalesce. These conditions of pressure and
temperature serve to locate the critical point for the fluid. We define
the density difference \(\rho_{liq}-\rho_{vap}\) to be the order
parameter for the liquid-gas phase transition. We shall meet order
parameters for other, more complex, systems in
\textbf{?@sec-landau-theory},

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{phase-transitions/Figs/ljpd1.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-fluidpd}Phase diagram of a simple fluid (schematic)}

\end{figure}%

In the vicinity of a critical point, a system displays a host of
remarkable behaviors known as \emph{critical phenomena}. Chief among
these is the divergence of thermal response functions---such as specific
heat, compressibility, or magnetic susceptibility---which signal an
enhanced sensitivity to external perturbations. These singularities
arise from the emergence of large-scale cooperative interactions among
the system's microscopic constituents, as measured by a diverging
\emph{correlation length} (see Chapter~\ref{sec-background}). One
visually striking manifestation of this is \emph{critical opalescence},
particularly observed in fluids like CO\(_2\). As carbon dioxide nears
its critical temperature and pressure, the distinction between its
liquid and gas phases vanishes, giving rise to huge fluctuations in
density. These fluctuations scatter visible light, rendering the fluid
milky or opalescent. This scattering effect directly reflects the
long-range correlations developing within the fluid. The movie below
illustrates the effect as the critical temperature of CO\(_2\) is
approached from above. Note the appearence of a liquid-vapour interface
(meniscus) as the system enters the two-phase region.

\url{Movies/critical_point_1.mp4}

The recalcitrant problem posed by the critical region is how best to
incorporate such collective effects within the framework of a rigorous
mathematical theory that affords both physical insight and quantitative
explanation of the observed phenomena. This matter has been (and still
is!) the subject of intense theoretical activity.

The importance of the critical point stems largely from the fact that
many of the phenomena observed in its vicinity are believed to be common
to a whole range of apparently quite disparate physical systems. Systems
such as liquid mixtures, superconductors, liquid crystals, ferromagnets,
antiferromagnets and molecular crystals may display identical behaviour
near criticality. This observation implies a profound underlying
similarity among physical systems at criticality, regardless of many
aspects of their distinctive microscopic nature. These ideas have found
formal expression in the so-called `universality hypothesis' which,
since its inception in the 1970s, has enjoyed considerable success.

In the next few lectures, principal aspects of the contemporary
theoretical viewpoint of phase transitions and critical phenomena will
be reviewed. Mean field theories of phase transitions will be discussed
and their inadequacies in the critical region will be exposed. The
phenomenology of the critical region will we described including power
laws, critical exponents and their relationship to scaling phenomena.
These will be set within the context of the powerful renormalisation
group technique. The notion of universality as a phenomenological
hypothesis will be introduced and its implications for real and model
systems will be explored. Finally, the utility of finite-size scaling
methods for computer studies of critical phenomena will be discussed,
culminating in the introduction of a specific technique suitable for
exposing universality in model systems. Thereafter we will consider some
foundational concepts in the dynamics of complex disordered matter. We
shall look at the processes by which one phase transform into another
and introduce differential equations that allow us to deal with the
inherent stochasticity of thermal systems. The wider applicability of
these unifying concepts to complex disordered systems such as colloids,
polymers, liquid crystals and glasses will be covered in part 2 of the
course.

\chapter{Key concepts for phase transitions}\label{sec-background}

\section{Observables and expectation
values}\label{observables-and-expectation-values}

In seeking to describe phase transition and critical phenomena, it is
useful to have a quantitative measure of the difference between the
phases: this is the role of the \emph{order parameter}, \(Q\). In the
case of the fluid, the order parameter is taken as the difference
between the densities of the liquid and vapour phases. In the
ferromagnet it is taken as the magnetisation. As its name suggest, the
order parameter serves as a measure of the kind of orderliness that sets
in when the temperature is cooled below a critical temperature.

Our first task is to give some feeling for the principles which underlie
the ordering process. Referring back to \textbf{?@sec-canonical}, the
probability \(p_a\) that a physical system at temperature \(T\) will
have a particular microscopic arrangement (alternatively referred to as
a `configuration' or `state'), labelled \(a\), of energy \(E_a\) is

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-probs}{
p_a=\frac{1}{Z}e^{-E_a/k_BT}
}\end{equation}

The prefactor \(Z^{-1}\) is the \emph{partition function}: since the
system must always have \emph{some} specific arrangement, the sum of the
probabilities \(p_a\) must be unity, implying that

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-partition}{
Z=\sum_ae^{-E_a/k_BT}
}\end{equation} where the sum extends over all possible microscopic
arrangements.

These equations assume that physical system evolves rapidly (on the
timescale of typical observations) amongst all its allowed arrangements,
sampling them with the probabilities~Equation~\ref{eq-probs} the
expectation value of any physical observable \(O\) will thus be given by
averaging \(O\) over all the arrangements \(a\), weighting each
contribution by the appropriate probability:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-observable}{\overline {O}=\frac{1}{Z}\sum_a O_a e^{-E_a/k_BT}
}\end{equation}

Sums like Equation~\ref{eq-observable} are not easily evaluated because
the number of terms grows exponentially in the system size.
Nevertheless, some important insights follow painlessly. Consider the
case where the observable of interest is the order parameter, or more
specifically the magnetisation of a ferromagnet.

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-op}{
Q=\frac{1}{Z}\sum_a Q_a e^{-E_a/k_BT}
}\end{equation}

It is clear from Equation~\ref{eq-probs} that at very low temperature
the system will be overwhelmingly likely to be found in its minimum
energy arrangements (ground states). For the ferromagnet, these are the
fully ordered spin arrangements having magnetisation \(+1\), or \(-1\).

Now consider the high temperature limit. The enhanced weight that the
fully ordered arrangement carries in the sum of Equation~\ref{eq-op} by
virtue of its low energy, is now no longer sufficient to offset the fact
that arrangements in which \(Q_a\) has some intermediate value, though
each carry a smaller weight, are vastly greater in number. A little
thought shows that the arrangements which have essentially zero
magnetisation (equal populations of up and down spins) are by far the
most numerous. At high temperature, these disordered arrangements
dominate the sum in Equation~\ref{eq-op} and the order parameter is
zero.

The competition between energy-of-arrangements weighting (or simply
`energy') and the `number of arrangements' weighting (or `entropy') is
then the key principle at work here. The distinctive feature of a system
with a critical point is that, in the course of this competition, the
system is forced to choose amongst a number of macroscopically different
sets of microscopic arrangements.

Finally in this section, we note that the probabilistic (statistical
mechanics) approach to thermal systems outlined above is completely
compatible with classical thermodynamics. Specifically, the bridge
between the two disciplines is provided by the following equation

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-free}{
F=-k_BT \ln Z
}\end{equation}

where \(F\) is the ``Helmholtz free energy''. All thermodynamic
observables, for example the order parameter \(Q\), and response
functions such as the specific heat or magnetic susceptibility are
obtainable as appropriate derivatives of the free energy. For instance,
utilizing Equation~\ref{eq-partition}, one can readily verify (try it as
an exercise!) that the average internal energy is given by

\[\overline{E}=-\frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta},\]

where \(\beta=(k_BT)^{-1}\).

The relationship between other thermodynamic quantities and derivatives
of the free energy are given in fig. Figure~\ref{fig-thermo}

\section{Correlations}\label{sec-correlations}

\subsection{Spatial correlations}\label{spatial-correlations}

The two-point connected correlation function measures how fluctuations
at two spatial points are statistically related. For a scalar field
\(\phi(\vec{R})\), which could represent eg. the local magnetisation
\(m\) in a magnet at position vector \(\vec{R}\), or the local particle
number density \(\rho\) in a fluid, it is defined as:

\[
C(r) = \langle \phi(\vec{R}) \phi(\vec{R} + \vec{r}) \rangle - \langle \phi(\vec{R}) \rangle^2,
\]

where \(\langle \cdot \rangle\) denotes an ensemble or spatial average
over all \(\vec{R}\), and \(r = |\vec{r}|\) is the spatial separation
between the two points.

\(C(r)\) quantifies the spatial extent over which field values are
correlated and in homogeneous and isotropic systems, it depends only on
the separation \(r\).

If \(C(r)\) decays quickly, we say that correlations are short-ranged.
Typically this occurs well away from criticality and takes the form of
exponential decay

\[
  C(r) \sim e^{-r/\xi}
  \] where the correlation length \(\xi\) is the characteristic scale
over which correlations decay.

Near a critical point \(C(r)\) decays more slowly - in a power-law
fashion - and correlations are long-ranged.

\[
  C(r) \sim r^{-(d - 2 + \eta)}
  \] where \(d\) is the spatial dimension and \(\eta\) is a critical
exponent.

In isotropic fluids and particle systems, a closely related and more
directly measurable quantity (particularly in simulations) is the
\textbf{radial distribution function} \(g(r)\), which describes how
particle density varies as a function of distance from a reference
particle. For such systems, the two-point correlation function of the
number density field \(\rho(\vec{r})\) is related to \(g(r)\) as
follows:

\[
g(r) = 1+\frac{C(r)}{\rho^2},
\] where \(\rho\) is the average number density. This relation shows
that \(g(r)\) encodes the same spatial correlations as \(C(r)\), but in
a form that is more natural for discrete particle systems. Note that by
definition \(g(r)\to 1\) in the absence of correlations ie. when
\(C(r)=0\). This is typically the case for \(r\gg\xi\).

Experimentally one doesn't typically have direct access to \(C(r)\), but
rather its Fourier transform known as the \textbf{structure factor}

\[
S(k) = \int d^d r \, e^{-i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{r}} \, C(r),
\] where \(k\) is the scattering wavevector.

In equilibrium:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  For short-range correlations (finite \(\xi\)), \(S(k)\) typically has
  a Lorentzian form: \[
  S(k) \sim \frac{1}{k^2 + \xi^{-2}}.
  \]
\item
  At criticality (where \(\xi \to \infty\)), \(S(k)\) follows a power
  law: \[
  S(k) \sim k^{-2 + \eta}.
  \]
\end{itemize}

This relation enables the extraction of \(\xi\) from experimental or
simulation data, especially via scattering techniques.

\subsection{Temporal correlations}\label{temporal-correlations}

Consider a thermodynamic variable \(x\) with zero mean that fluctuates
over time. Examples include the local magnetization in a magnetic system
or the local density in a fluid. Here, \(x\) represents a deviation from
the average value --- a fluctuation.

We're interested in how such fluctuations are correlated over time when
the system is in thermal equilibrium. For instance, if \(x\) is positive
at some time \(t\), it's more likely to remain positive shortly after.

These temporal correlations are characterized by the two-time
correlation function (also known as an auto-correlation function):

\[
\langle x(\tau) x(\tau + t) \rangle
\]

In equilibrium, the correlation function must be independent of the
starting time \(\tau\). Therefore, we define:

\[
\langle x(\tau) x(\tau + t) \rangle = M_{xx}(t)
\]

That is, \(M_{xx}(t)\) depends only on the time difference \(t\).

We typically expect \(M_{xx}(t)\) to decay exponentially over a
characteristic correlation time \(t_c\):

\[
M_{xx}(t) \sim \exp(-t / t_c)
\]

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{phase-transitions/Figs/Mxx(t).png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-Mxx}Sketch of \(M_{xx}(t)\) against \(t\)}

\end{figure}%

This exponential decay reflects how the memory of fluctuations fades
with time.

Now consider two different fluctuating variables, \(x\) and \(y\) (e.g.,
local magnetizations at different positions). Their cross-correlation
function is defined as:

\[
\langle x(\tau) y(\tau + t) \rangle = M_{xy}(t)
\]

This defines the elements of a dynamic correlation matrix, of which
\(M_{xx}(t)\) is the diagonal.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Tools for understanding complex
disordered matter}

\markboth{Tools for understanding complex disordered matter}{Tools for
understanding complex disordered matter}

Complex disordered systems are composed of an enormous number of
interacting components---typically on the order of \(\sim 10^{23}\).
These interactions can lead to fascinating emergent behaviour, but they
also render the systems analytically intractable; it is clearly
impossible to solve Newton's equations for such vast numbers of
particles. To address this difficulty, we turn to Statistical Mechanics,
which you first encountered in your second year. Statistical Mechanics
provides the essential framework for connecting the microscopic
behaviour of individual constituents with the macroscopic thermodynamic
and dynamical properties of the system as a whole.

In this section, we will revisit and expand upon key concepts relevant
to our discussion, with particular emphasis on the \textbf{free
energy}---a central quantity that captures the balance between energy
minimisation and entropy maximisation in determining the system's
equilibrium state. If any of these ideas feel unfamiliar, you may find
it useful to revise the Statistical Mechanics material from your Year 2
\emph{Thermal Physics} course notes.

\section*{Ensembles and free
energies}\label{ensembles-and-free-energies}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Ensembles and free energies}

\markright{Ensembles and free energies}

Statistical mechanics can be formulated in a variety of ensembles
reflecting the relationship between the system and its environment. In
what follows we summarise the formalism, focussing on the case of a
particle fluid. Analogous equations apply to lattice spin models (see
lectures and the book by Yeomans). Key ensembles are:

\subsection*{Microcanonical ensemble}\label{microcanonical-ensemble}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Microcanonical ensemble}

Applies to a system of \(N\) particles (or spins) in a fixed volume
\(V\) having adiabatic walls so that the internal energy \(E\) is
constant. Denoted as constant-\(NVE\). Let \(\Omega\) be the number of
(micro)states having the prescribed energy:

\[
\Omega=\sum_\textrm{all states having energy E}
\]

Thermodynamically, the states favored in the canonical ensemble are
those that maximise the entropy:

\[
S=k_B\ln \Omega\: .
\]

where \(k_B\) is Boltzmann's constant The microcanonical ensemble is
useful for defining the entropy, but is little used in practice.

\subsection*{Canonical ensemble}\label{sec-canonical}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Canonical ensemble}

Applies to a system of \(N\) particles in a fixed volume \(V\) and
coupled to a heat bath at temperature \(T\). Denoted as
constant-\(NVT\). A central quantity is the \emph{partition function}

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-ZNVT}{
Z_{NVT}=\sum_\textrm{ all states i}e^{-\beta E_i},~~~~~\beta=1/(k_BT)
}\end{equation} which is a weighted sum over the states. The partition
function provides the normalisation constant in the probability of
finding the system in a given state \(i\).

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-Pi}{
P_i=\frac{e^{-\beta E_i}}{Z_{NVT}}.
}\end{equation}

The states favored in the canonical ensemble are those that minimise the
free energy:

\[
F_{NVT}=-\beta^{-1}\ln Z_{NVT}\:.
\]

\(F_{NVT}\) is known as the Helmholtz free energy. Thermodynamics also
supplies a relation for the Helmholtz free energy:

\[
F_{NVT}=E-TS\:,
\] where \(E\) is the average internal energy. In minimising the free
energy, the system strikes a compromise between low energy and high
entropy. The temperature plays the role of arbiter, favouring high
entropy at high \(T\), and low energy at low \(T\). The canonical
ensemble is usually used to describe systems such as magnets, or a fluid
held at constant volume. It is the ensemble we shall use most in this
course.

\subsection*{Grand canonical ensemble}\label{sec-grandcanonical}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Grand canonical ensemble}

Applies to a system with a variable number of particle in a fixed volume
\(V\) coupled to both a heat bath at temperature \(T\) and a particle
reservoir with chemical potential \(\mu\) (which is the field conjugate
to \(N\)). Denoted as constant-\(\mu VT\).

The corresponding partition function is a weighted superset of the
canonical one

\[
Z_{\mu VT}=\sum_{N=0}^\infty e^{\beta\mu N}Z_{NVT}
\] and a state probability analogous to Equation~\ref{eq-Pi} holds. One
can recast this in a form similar to Equation~\ref{eq-ZNVT}:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-ZmuVT}{
Z_{\mu VT}=\sum_{N=0}^\infty\:\sum_\textrm{all~states~i}e^{-\beta {\cal H}_i},
}\end{equation} where \({\cal H}_i=E_i-\mu N\) is the form of the
Hamiltonian in the grand canonical ensemble.

Statistically, the states favored in the grand canonical ensemble are
those that minimise the free energy:

\[
F_{\mu VT}=-\beta^{-1}\ln Z_{\mu VT}
\] \(F_{\mu VT}\) is known as the grand potential. It can also be
derived from thermodynamics, from which one finds

\[
F_{\mu VT}=E-TS-\mu N=-pV,
\] where \(p\) is the pressure.

The grand canonical ensemble is usually used to describe systems such as
fluid connected to a particle reservoir. Sometimes for a magnet we
consider the effects of an applied magnetic field, which is analogous to
working in the grand canonical ensemble: the magnetic field (which is
conjugate to the magnetisation) plays a similar role to the chemical
potential in a fluid.

\subsection*{Isothermal-isobaric
ensemble}\label{isothermal-isobaric-ensemble}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Isothermal-isobaric ensemble}

Applies to a system with a fixed number of particles \(N\) that is
coupled to a heat bath at temperature \(T\) and a reservoir that exerts
a constant pressure \(p\) which allows the sample volume to fluctuate.
Denoted as constant-\(NpT\).

The corresponding partition function is a weighted superset of the
canonical one

\[
Z_{NpT}=\int_0^\infty dV  e^{-\beta p V}Z_{NVT}
\] or \begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-ZNpT}{
Z_{NVT}=\int_0^\infty dV\:\sum_\textrm{i}e^{-\beta {\cal H}_i},
}\end{equation} where \({\cal H}_i=E_i+pV\) is the form of the
Hamiltonian in the constant-\(NpT\) ensemble. Again a state probability
analogous to Equation~\ref{eq-Pi} holds.

Statistically, the states favored in the costant-NpT ensemble are those
that minimise the free energy:

\[
F_{NpT}=-\beta^{-1}\ln Z_{NpT}
\] \(F_{NpT}\) is known as the \emph{Gibb's free energy} (often denoted
\(G\)). It can also be derived from thermodynamics, from which one finds

\[
F_{NpT}=E-TS+pV=\mu N
\]

The constant-\(NpT\) ensemble is usually used to describe systems such
as a fluid subject to a variable pressure, or a magnet coupled to a
magnetic field \(H\). In the latter case the quantity \(HM\) plays the
role of \(pV\) and

\[
F_{NpT}=E-TS-MH\:,
\] with \(M\) the total magnetisation.

\section*{From free energies to
observables}\label{from-free-energies-to-observables}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{From free energies to observables}

\markright{From free energies to observables}

Free energies are not directly observable quantities. However, all
physical observables can be expressed in terms of \emph{derivatives} of
the free energy. One can derive the appropriate relations either from
Thermodynamics, or the corresponding statistical mechanics (Revise your
year-2 Thermal Physics notes on this if necessary). As an example let us
consider a fluid in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble for which the
appropriate free energy is \(F_{NpT}=E-TS+pV\), and where the volume
fluctuates in response to the prescribed pressure. We shall seek an
expression for the average volume in terms of the free energy. First
lets us take the thermodynamic route. Differentiating the free energy
and applying the chain rule we have:

\[
dF=dE-TdS-sdT+pdV+VdP\:.
\] But from the first law of thermodynamics, \(dE=TdS-pdV\), so

\[
dF=-SdT+Vdp\:,
\] and rearranging yields \[
V=\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial p}\right)_T\:.
\]

We can now show that this result is consistent with the definition of
\(F_{NpT}\) in terms of the partition function. Write

\[
Z_{NpT}=\int_0^\infty dV  e^{-\beta p V}Z_{NVT}=\int_0^\infty dV\sum_{all~states~i}e^{-\beta (p V_i+E_i)}
\]

Then

\[
\begin{align}
\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial p}\right)_T
&= -\frac{1}{\beta} \left(\frac{\partial \ln Z_{NpT}}{\partial p}\right)_T \\
&= -\frac{1}{\beta} \frac{1}{Z_{NpT}} \frac{\partial Z_{NpT}}{\partial p} \\
&= -\frac{1}{\beta} \frac{1}{Z_{NpT}} \int_0^\infty dV \int_{\text{all states}} (-\beta V) e^{-\beta (p V + E)} \\
&= \langle V \rangle_T \,.
\end{align}
\]

where in the last step we have used the fact that the probability of a
state is defined to be \(e^{-\beta (p V_i+E_i)}/Z_{NpT}\).

\emph{Exercise}. Repeat these manipulations to find an expression for
the mean particle number \(N\) in the grand canonical ensemble

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-caution-color-frame, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, opacityback=0, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-caution-color!10!white, coltitle=black, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-caution-color}{\faFire}\hspace{0.5em}{Solution}, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, bottomtitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, leftrule=.75mm, left=2mm]

In the grand canonical ensemble (GCE), the relevant free energy is

\[
F_{\mu VT} = E - TS - \mu N
\]

From the first law of thermodynamics changes in the internal energy are
given by:

\[
dE = TdS - PdV + \mu dN=TdS+\mu dN
\] where we have used the fact that \(V\) is fixed in the GCE, so
\(dV=0\).

Differentiating \(F_{\mu VT}\):

\[
dF_{\mu VT} = dE - TdS - SdT - \mu dN - N d\mu
= -S dT - N d\mu
\] where for the last equality we have substitued for \(dE\) from above.

Thus \[
\left( \frac{\partial F_{\mu VT}}{\partial \mu} \right)_{T, V} = -N
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\langle N \rangle = -\left( \frac{\partial F_{\mu VT}}{\partial \mu} \right)_{T, V}
\]

Now consider the statistical mechanics route to calculate
\(\langle N\rangle\):

\[
Z_{\mu V T} = \sum_{N=0}^{\infty} \sum_{\text{states}} e^{-\beta (E_{N,i} - \mu N)}
\]

The grand potential (now written as \(F_{\mu VT}\)) is:

\[
F_{\mu VT} = -k_B T \ln Z_{\mu V T}
\]

We now differentiate:

\[
\left( \frac{\partial F_{\mu VT}}{\partial \mu} \right)_T = -k_B T \left( \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial Z_{\mu V T}}{\partial \mu} \right)
\]

From the partition function

\[
\frac{\partial Z_{\mu V T}}{\partial \mu} = \sum_{N=0}^\infty \sum_{\text{states}} \left( \beta N \right) e^{-\beta (E_{N,i} - \mu N)} 
\]

Substitute:

\[
\left( \frac{\partial F_{\mu VT}}{\partial \mu} \right)_T = -k_B T \cdot \beta \cdot \frac{1}{Z_{\mu V T}} \sum_{N=0}^\infty \sum_{\text{states}} N\, e^{-\beta (E_{N,i} - \mu N)} = - \langle N \rangle
\]

where in the last step we have used the fact that in the GCE the
Boltzmann probability of a microstate is defined to be
\(e^{-\beta (E_{N,i}-\mu N)}/Z_{\mu VT}\).

\end{tcolorbox}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{1. Existence of a phase transition in

In lectures it was argued that no long ranged order occurs at
finite-temperatures in a one dimensional system because of the presence
of domain walls. Were macroscopic domain walls to exist in two
dimensions at finite temperature, they would similarly destroy long
ranged order and prevent a phase transition. By calculating the free
energy of a 2D domain wall for an Ising lattice, show that domain walls
do not in fact exist for sufficiently low \(T\).

(Hint: Model the domain wall as a non-reversing \(N\)-step random walk

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{2. Correlation Length}

For a 1D Ising model, show that the correlation between the spins at

of domain walls between \(i\) and \(j\) and \(p_m\) is the probability
of finding \(m\) domain walls between them.

Hence show that when \(R_{ij}=|i-j|a\) is large (with \(a\) the lattice
spacing) and the temperature is small, that

\[\langle s_i s_j\rangle =\exp(-R_{ij}/\xi)\] with \(\xi=a/2p\) and
\(p\) the probability of finding a domain wall on a bond.

\emph{Hint: In the second part note that \(p_m\) is given by a binomial
distribution because there is a probability \(p\) of each bond
containing a domain wall and \((1-p)\) that it doesn't. What special
type of distribution does \(p_m\) tend to when \(p\) is small (as occurs

\subsection*{3. A model fluid}\label{a-model-fluid}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3. A model fluid}

The van der Waals (vdW) equation of state is essentially a mean field
theory for fluids. It relates the pressure and the volume of a fluid to
the temperature:

\[\left(P+\frac{a}{V^2}\right)(V-b)=N_Ak_BT\] where \(a\) and \(b\) are
constants and \(N_A\) is Avogadro's number.

The critical point of a fluid corresponds to the point at which the
isothermal compressibility diverges, that is

\[\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_T=0\] Additionally, one
finds that isotherms of \(P\) versus \(V\) exhibit a point of inflection
at the critical point, that is

\[\left(\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial V^2}\right)_T=0\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Use these two requirements to show that the critical point of the vdW
  fluid is located at

  \[V_c=3b, ~~~ P_c=\frac{a}{27b^2},~~~ N_AK_BT_c=\frac{8a}{27b}\]
\item
  Hence show that when written in terms of reduced variables

  \[p=\frac{P}{P_c}, ~~~~ v=\frac{V}{V_c} ~~~~ t=\frac{T}{T_c}\]

  the equation takes the form

  \[\left(p+\frac{3}{v^2}\right)(v-\frac{1}{3})=\frac{8t}{3}\]
\item
  Write a Python script to plot a selection of isotherms close to the
  critical temperature (you will need to choose suitable units for your
  axes). Plot also the gradient and second derivative of \(P\) vs \(V\)
  on the critical isotherm and confirm numerically that it exhibits a
  point of inflection at the critical pressure and temperature.
\item
  Obtain the value of the critical exponent \(\gamma\) of the vdW model
  and confirm that it takes a mean-field value.

Consider a Landau expression for the free energy of a magnetic system
having magnetisation \(m\):

\[
F=F_0+\tilde{a}_2tm^2+a_4m^4-Hm\:,
\] where \(t=T-T_c\) and \(H\) is an applied magnetic field;
\(\tilde{a}_2\) and \(a_4\) are positive constants and \(F_0\) is a
constant background term.

Show that the equation of state for the model is

\[
H=2\tilde{a}_2tm+4a_4m^3\:.
\]

Use the near-critical power law behaviour of \(m\) to show that the
equation of state may be written in the scaling form

\[
\frac{H}{m^\delta}=g\left(\frac{t}{m^{1/\beta}}\right)\:,
\] and find the (mean field) values of the critical exponents \(\delta\)
and \(\beta\).

Deduce that \(g(x)=x+1\) up to a choice of scale for \(\tilde{a}_2\) and
\(a_4\).

\subsection*{10. Scaling laws}\label{scaling-laws}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{10. Scaling laws}

Using the generalised homogeneous form for the free energy given in
lectures, take appropriate derivatives to find the relationships to the
critical exponents:

\[
\beta=\frac{1-b}{a}; ~~ \gamma=\frac{2b-1}{a};~~ \delta= \frac{b}{1-b}; ~~~ \alpha=2-\frac{1}{a}.
\]

Hence derive the scaling laws among the critical exponents:

\begin{align}
\alpha+\beta(\delta+1)=& 2 \\
\alpha+2\beta+\gamma =& 2\\
%\gamma=\beta(\delta-1)
\end{align}

(\emph{Hint: For the heat capacity exponent \(\alpha\) use the result
from problem 8:
\(C_H=-T\left(\frac{\partial^2F}{\partial T^2}\right)_{h=0}\)})

\subsection*{11. Classical nucleation
theory}\label{classical-nucleation-theory}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{11. Classical nucleation theory}

A supercooled liquid metal is undergoing solidification. According to
classical nucleation theory, the Gibbs free energy change \(\Delta G\)
for forming a spherical solid nucleus of radius \(r\) in the liquid is
given by:

\[
\Delta G(r) = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \Delta G_v + 4\pi r^2 \gamma
\] where \(\Delta G_v < 0\) is the free energy change per unit volume
due to the phase change, and \(\gamma > 0\) is the interfacial energy
between the solid and liquid phases.

\textbf{(a)} Derive the expression for the critical radius \(r^*\) at
which the nucleus becomes stable and begins to grow.

\textbf{(b)} Show that the critical energy barrier for nucleation
\(\Delta G^*\) is given by:

\[
\Delta G^* = \frac{16\pi \gamma^3}{3 (\Delta G_v)^2}
\]

\textbf{(c)} Explain qualitatively how the degree of undercooling
\(\Delta T\) affects the rate of nucleation. You may use the fact that
\(\Delta G_v \propto \Delta T\) to support your answer.

\subsection*{12. Colloidal diffusion}\label{colloidal-diffusion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{12. Colloidal diffusion}

A large colloidal particle of mass \(M\) moves in a fluid under the
influence of a random force \(F(t)\) and a coefficient of Stokes
friction drag \(\gamma\), both per unit mass. If the solution of the
corresponding Langevin equation for the velocity of the colloidal
particle is given by

\[
u = u_0 e^{-\gamma t} + \frac{e^{-\gamma t}}{M} \int_0^t dt' \, e^{\gamma t'} F(t'),
\]

where \(u_0\) is the velocity at \(t = 0\), show that for long times the
velocity of the particle satisfies the relation

\[
\langle u^2 \rangle = \frac{kT}{M} + \left( u_0^2 - \frac{kT}{M} \right) e^{-2\gamma t},
\]

where \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant and \(T\) is the absolute
temperature.

State clearly any assumptions that you make.

\subsection*{13. Einstein's expression for the diffusion
coefficient}\label{einsteins-expression-for-the-diffusion-coefficient}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{13. Einstein's expression for the
diffusion coefficient}

In 1905, Einstein showed that the friction coefficient \(\gamma\) (per
unit mass) of a colloidal particle must be related to the diffusion
coefficient \(D\) of the particle by

\[
D = \frac{kT}{\gamma}.
\]

If a marked particle covers a distance \(X\) in a given time \(t\)
(assuming a one-dimensional random walk), the diffusion coefficient is
defined to be

\[
D = \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{2t} \langle [X(t) - X(0)]^2 \rangle,
\]

where the average \(\langle \cdot \rangle\) is taken over an ensemble in
thermal equilibrium.

Use the fact that \(X(t) - X(0)
= \int_{0}^{t} u(t')\,\mathrm{d}t'\) to show that the Einstein relation
may be written as

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{D}{kT} = \frac{1}{kT} \int_0^\infty \langle u(t_0) u(t_0 + t) \rangle \, dt,
\]

where \(\mu\) is known as the mobility of the particle and \(t_0\) is
any arbitrarily chosen time.

\subsection*{14. Life in one dimension}\label{life-in-one-dimension}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{14. Life in one dimension}

A particle lives on the sites of a one-dimensional lattice. At any
instant it has probability \(\alpha\) per unit time that it will hop to
the site on its right and probability \(\alpha\) per unit time of
hopping to the site on its left.

Write down the master equation for the set of probabilities \(p_n(t)\)
of finding the particle at the \(n^{\text{th}}\) site, where
\(-\infty < n < \infty\).

Solve the master equation for the \(p_n\), subject to the initial
condition that the particle was at the site \(n = 0\) at time \(t = 0\).
Hence obtain the mean position \(\langle n \rangle\) and root mean
square deviation from the mean, both as functions of time.

\textbf{Hint}: The second part of the question is most easily done by
introducing the generating function

\[
F(z, t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} p_n(t) z^n.
\]

\subsection*{15. Master equation}\label{master-equation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{15. Master equation}

A system of \(N\) atoms, each having two energy levels
\(E = \pm \epsilon\), is brought into contact with a heat bath at
temperature \(T\). The atoms do not interact with each other, but each
atom interacts with the heat bath to have a probability
\(\lambda_{-\to+}(T)\) per unit time of transition from lower to higher
level, and a probability \(\lambda_{+\to-}(T)\) per unit time of the
reverse transition.

If at any time \(t\) there are \(n_+(t)\) atoms at the higher level and
\(n_-(t)\) at the lower level, then \(n(t) = n_-(t) - n_+(t)\) is a
convenient measure of the non-equilibrium state.

Obtain the master equation for \(n(t)\) and hence the relaxation time
\(\tau\) which characterizes the exponential approach of the system to
equilibrium.

\subsection*{16. Detailed balance}\label{detailed-balance}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{16. Detailed balance}

\textbf{(a)} Starting from the principle of detailed balance for an
isolated system, show that for two groups of states within it, \(A\) and
\(B\), the overall rate of transitions from group \(A\) to group \(B\)
is balanced, in equilibrium, by those from \(B\) to \(A\):

\[
\lambda_{A \to B} p^{\text{eq}}_A = \lambda_{B \to A} p^{\text{eq}}_B
\]

\textbf{(b)} Deduce that the principle applies to microstates in the
canonical ensemble, and hence that the jump rates between states of a
subsystem (of fixed number of particles) connected to a heat bath must
obey

\[
\frac{\lambda_{i \to j}}{\lambda_{j \to i}} = e^{-(E_j - E_i)/kT}.
\]

\subsection*{17. Jump processes}\label{jump-processes}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{17. Jump processes}

An isolated system can occupy three possible states of the same energy.
The kinetics are such that it can jump from state 1 to 2 and 2 to 3 but
not directly from 1 to 3. Per unit time, there is a probability
\(\lambda_0\) that the system makes a jump, from the state it is in,
into (each of) the other state(s) it can reach.

\textbf{(a)} Show that the occupancy probabilities
\(p = (p_1, p_2, p_3)\) of the three states obey the master equation

\[
\dot{p} = M \cdot p
\]

where the rate matrix is

\[
M = \lambda_0 \begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & -2 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\textbf{(b)} Confirm that an equilibrium state is \(p = (1, 1, 1)/3\).

\textbf{(c)} Prove this equilibrium state is unique.

\textbf{Hint}: For part (c), consider the eigenvalues of \(M\).
