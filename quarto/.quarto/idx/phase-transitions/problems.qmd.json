If you don't get very far with some,\ndon't worry. We'll be going over them in problems classes, so you can\njust regard them as worked examples.\n\n1.  **Existence of a phase transition in $d=2$.**\n\n    (Straightforward) In lectures it was argued that no long ranged\n    order occurs at finite-temperatures in a one dimensional system\n    because of the presence of domain walls. Were macroscopic domain\n    walls to exist in two dimensions at finite temperature, they would\n    similarly destroy long ranged order and prevent a phase transition.\n    By calculating the free energy of a 2D domain wall for an Ising\n    lattice, show that domain walls do not in fact exist for\n    sufficiently low $T$.\n\n    (*Hint: Model the domain wall as a non-reversing $N$-step random\n    walk on the lattice and find an expression for its energy and -from\n    the number of random walk configurations- its entropy.*)\n\n---\n\n2.  **Correlation Length**\n\n    (Challenging) For a 1D Ising model, show that the correlation\n    between the spins at sites $i$ and $j$, is\n\n    $$\\langle s_i s_j\\rangle =\\sum_m p_m(-1)^m$$ where $m$ is the number\n    of domain walls between $i$ and $j$ and $p_m$ is the probability of\n    finding $m$ domain walls between them.\n\n    Hence show that when $R_{ij}=|i-j|a$ is large (with $a$ the lattice\n    spacing) and the temperature is small, that\n\n    $$\\langle s_i s_j\\rangle =\\exp(-R_{ij}/\\xi)$$ with $\\xi=a/2p$ and\n    $p$ the probability of finding a domain wall on a bond.\n\n    *Hint: In the second part note that $p_m$ is given by a binomial\n    distribution because there is a probability $p$ of each bond\n    containing a domain wall and $(1-p)$ that it doesn't. What special\n    type of distribution does $p_m$ tend to when $p$ is small (as occurs\n    at low $T$)?*\n\n---\n\n3.  **A model fluid**\n\n    (Straightforward) The van der Waals (vdW) equation of state (recall\n    PH10002) is essentially a mean field theory for fluids. It relates\n    the pressure and the volume of a fluid to the temperature:\n\n    $$\\left(P+\\frac{a}{V^2}\\right)(V-b)=N_Ak_BT$$ where $a$ and $b$ are\n    constants and $N_A$ is Avogadro's number.\n\n    The critical point of a fluid corresponds to the point at which the\n    isothermal compressibility diverges, that is\n\n    $$\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V}\\right)_T=0$$ Additionally, one\n    finds that isotherms of $P$ versus $V$ exhibit a point of inflection\n    at the critical point, that is\n\n    $$\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial V^2}\\right)_T=0$$\n\n    - Use these two requirements to show that the critical point of the\n      vdW fluid is located at\n\n      $$V_c=3b, ~~~ P_c=\\frac{a}{27b^2},~~~ N_AK_BT_c=\\frac{8a}{27b}$$\n\n    - Hence show that when written in terms of reduced variables\n\n      $$p=\\frac{P}{P_c}, ~~~~ v=\\frac{V}{V_c} ~~~~ t=\\frac{T}{T_c}$$\n\n      the equation takes the form\n\n      $$\\left(p+\\frac{3}{v^2}\\right)(v-\\frac{1}{3})=\\frac{8t}{3}$$\n\n    - Use a graph-plotting program such as \"Excel\" to plot a selection\n      of isotherms close to the critical temperature (you will need to\n      choose suitable units for your axes). Plot also the gradient and\n      second derivative of P vs V on the critical isotherm and confirm\n      numerically that it exhibits a point of inflection at the critical\n      pressure and temperature.\n\n    - Obtain the value of the critical exponent $\\gamma$ of the vdW\n      model and confirm that it takes a mean-field value.\n\n---\n\n4.  **Mean field theory of the Ising model heat capacity**\n\n    (Straightforward) Using results derived in lectures, obtain an\n    expression for the mean energy $\\langle E\\rangle$ of the Ising model\n    in zero field, within the simplest mean field approximation $\\langle\n      s_is_j\\rangle=\\langle s_i\\rangle\\langle s_j\\rangle=m^2$. Hence\n    show that for $H=0$ the heat capacity $\\partial \\langle\n      E\\rangle/\\partial T$ has the behaviour\n\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    C_H=& 0 ~~~~ T>T_c\\\\\n    C_H=& 3Nk_B/2 ~~~~ T\\le T_c\n    \\end{aligned}\n\n---\n\n5.  **Magnetisation and fluctuations**\n\n    (Slightly tricky) A system of spins on a lattice, has, in the\n    absence of an applied field, a Hamiltonian ${\\cal H}$. In the\n    presence of a field $h$ the Hamiltonian becomes\n    $$\\tilde {\\cal H}={\\cal H}-hM$$ where $M$ is the total magnetisation\n    and $h$ is the magnetic field. By considering the partition function\n    $Z(T,h)$ and its relationship to the free energy $F$ show that in\n    general\n\n    $$\\langle M \\rangle=-\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial h}\\right)_T$$\n\n    Show also that the variance of the magnetisation fluctuations is\n\n    $$\\langle M^2\\rangle-\\langle M\\rangle^2=-k_BT\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial h^2}\\right)_T$$\n\n    (*Hint: This is an important standard derivation found in many text\n    books on Statistical Mechanics. You will need to differentiate $F$\n    (twice) and use the product and chain rules.*)\n\n---\n\n6.  **Spin-1 Ising model**\n\n    (Straightforward) A set of spins on a lattice of coordination number\n    $q$ can take values $(-1,0,1)$, as opposed to just $(-1,1)$ as in\n    the spin-1/2 Ising model. The Hamiltonian is\n\n    $${\\cal H}=-J\\sum_{<ij>}s_is_j + h\\sum_i s_i$$\n\n    Find the partition function and hence show that in the mean field\n    approximation, the magnetisation per site obeys\n\n    $$m=\\frac{2\\sinh[\\beta(Jqm+h)]}{2\\cosh[\\beta(Jqm+h)]+1}$$\n\n    and find the critical temperature $T_c$ at which the net\n    magnetisation vanishes.\n\n---\n\n7.  **Transfer Matrix.**\n\n    (Straightforward strategy but some lengthy algebra required)\n\n    Verify the calculation of the free energy of the 1D periodic chain\n    Ising model in a field outlined in lectures using the Transfer\n    Matrix method.\n\n    Use your results to show that the spontaneous magnetisation is:\n\n    $$m=\\frac{\\sinh \\beta H}{\\sqrt{\\sinh^2\\beta H+\\exp{-4\\beta J}}}$$\n    Comment on the value of $m$ in zero field.\n\n    (*Hint: Follow the prescription given in lectures. Depending on your\n    approach you may need to use the trigonometrical identities\n    $\\cosh^2x-\\sinh^2x=1$, $\\cosh(2x)=2\\cosh^2x-1$.*)\n\n---\n\n8.  **Lattice gas model** (Straightforward). Check the claim, made in\n    lectures that the \"Hamiltonian\" of the Lattice Gas model in the\n    grand canonical ensemble\n\n    $${\\cal H}_{LG}=-\\epsilon\\sum_{<i,j>}c_ic_j -\\mu\\sum_ic_i$$\n\n    is transformed to that of the Ising model by means of the change of\n    variable\n\n    $$s_i=2c_i-1;~~~~ J=\\frac{\\epsilon}{4}~~~~\n    h=\\frac{\\epsilon q+2\\mu}{4}$$\n\n    (*Hint: Note that when doing sums over bonds $\\sum_{\\langle\n        i,j\\rangle}$ for a lattice of coordination $q$ there are $q/2$\n    bonds per site since each bond is shared between two sites.*)\n\n---\n\n9.  **Landau theory**\n\n    Check and complete the Landau theory calculations, given in\n    lectures, for the critical exponents $\\gamma=1$ and $\\alpha=0$ of\n    the Ising model. For the latter, you should first prove the result\n\n    $$C_H =-T\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial T^2}$$ starting from the\n    classical theormodynamics expression for changes in the free energy\n    of a magnet $dF=-SdT-MdH$.\n\n    (*Hint: If you get stuck with the proof see standard thermodynamics\n    text books. To get the susceptibility exponent in Landau theory add\n    a term $-Hm$ to the Hamiltonian.*)\n\n---\n\n10. **Scaling laws**\n\n    (Straightforward.)Using the generalised homogeneous form for the\n    free energy given in lectures, take appropriate derivatives to find\n    the relationships to the critical exponents:\n\n    $$\\beta=\\frac{1-b}{a}; ~~ \\gamma=\\frac{2b-1}{a};~~ \\delta= \\frac{b}{1-b}; ~~~ \\alpha=2-\\frac{1}{a}.$$\n\n    Hence derive the scaling laws among the critical exponents:\n\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    \\alpha+\\beta(\\delta+1)=2 \\\\\n    \\alpha+2\\beta+\\gamma=2\\\\\n    %\\gamma=\\beta(\\delta-1)\n    \\end{aligned} (*Hint: For the heat capacity exponent $\\alpha$ use\n    the result from problem 9:\n    $C_H=-T\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2F}{\\partial T^2}\\right)_{h=0}$*)\n\n---\n\n11. **Renormalization Group transformation for the 1D Ising model**\n\n    (Challenging.) Consider a 1D Ising model of $N$ spins in zero field\n    given by the Hamiltonian\n\n    $${\\cal H}_I/k_BT=-K\\sum_{<ij>}s_is_j -\\sum_iC$$ where a background\n    term is included because even if set zero initially, it will be\n    generated by an RG transformation.\n\n    - A renormalisation is to be implemented with a scale factor $b=2$.\n      By partially performing the sum in the partition function over the\n      spins on the even numbered lattice sites, show that the partially\n      summed partition function can be written\n\n      $$Z=\\sum_{s_1,s_3,s_5...}\\prod_{i=2,4,6...} [\\exp\n      [K(s_{i-1}+s_{i+1})+2C] + \\exp[-K(s_{i-1}+s_{i+1})+2C]$$\n\n    - Next, relabel the remaining (odd numbered) spins so that they are\n      numbered consecutively eg by an index $j$ (this is a matter of\n      convenience only). Then cast this partially summed partition\n      function in a form that makes it look the same as that for an\n      Ising model with $N/2$ spins. i.e. require that $Z^\\prime$ has the\n      form\n\n      $$Z=\\sum_{\\{s\\}}\\prod_{j=1}^{N/2}\\exp[K^\\prime s_js_{j+1}+C^\\prime]\\:,$$\n      for all $s_j,s_{j+1}=\\pm 1$.\n\n      Hence show that the effective coupling $K^\\prime$, and background\n      constant $C^\\prime$ of the renormalised system are related to\n      those of the underlying Hamiltonian by\n\n      \\begin{aligned}\n      \\exp(K^\\prime+C^\\prime) &=& \\exp(2C)[\\exp(2K)+\\exp(-2K)] \\\\\n      \\exp(-K^\\prime+C^\\prime) &=& 2\\exp(2C)\n      \\end{aligned}\n\n    - Use these results to show that the effective coupling flows under\n      the renormalization according to:\n\n      $$K^\\prime = (1/2)\\ln (\\cosh 2K)$$\n\n      Does this flow drive the effective coupling to the low or high\n      temperature fixed point?\n\n    - Finally show that the partition function transforms under the RG\n      as\n\n      $$Z(K,N)=2^{N/2}\\exp(NK^\\prime/2)Z(K^\\prime,N/2)$$\n\n    *Note. The above is a hard question, which we'll go over this in\n    detail in a problems class. So if you don't make much progress,\n    don't worry, just treat it as a worked example.*\n\n---\n\n12. **RG flow of the free energy**\n\n    (Straightforward) An alternative RG equation for the effective\n    coupling in the 1D Ising model is\n\n    $$K = (1/2)\\cosh^{-1}(\\exp 2K^\\prime)$$ which is the inverse of the\n    transformation found in the previous question. This transformation\n    thus drives the system from small effective coupling (high\n    temperature) to high effective coupling (low temperature).\n\n    Under the transformation, the free energy density transforms like\n\n    $$\\beta f(K)=(1/2)\\beta f(K^\\prime)-(1/2)\\ln 2-K^\\prime/2\\:.$$\n\n    - Use these findings to iteratively calculate the free energy\n      density of the Ising model at low temperatures, starting from the\n      high temperature limit.\n\n      *Hint: Start with a very low coupling eg. $K^\\prime=0.01$, and\n      show that because interactions between spins are negligible,\n      $\\beta f(K^\\prime)\\approx\n      -\\ln 2$. Then iterate the RG equations above $8$ or so times to\n      generate a sequence of $K$ and $\\beta f(K)$ values.*\n\n    - Compare your results for each iteration with the exact results for\n      the free energy density of the 1D Ising model obtained in\n      lectures.\n---\n\n13. **Colloidal diffusion**\n\nA large colloidal particle of mass $M$ moves in a fluid under the influence of a random force $F(t)$ and a coefficient of Stokes friction drag $\\gamma$, both per unit mass. If the solution of the corresponding Langevin equation for the velocity of the colloidal particle is given by\n\n$$\nu = u_0 e^{-\\gamma t} + e^{-\\gamma t} \\int_0^t dt' \\, e^{\\gamma t'} F(t'),\n$$\n\nwhere $u_0$ is the velocity at $t = 0$, show that for long times the velocity of the particle satisfies the relation\n\n$$\n\\langle u^2 \\rangle = \\frac{kT}{M} + \\left( u_0^2 - \\frac{kT}{M} \\right) e^{-2\\gamma t},\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nState clearly any assumptions that you make.\n\n---\n\n14.  **Einstein's expression for the diffusion coefficient**\n\nIn 1905, Einstein showed that the friction coefficient $\\gamma$ (per unit mass) of a colloidal particle must be related to the diffusion coefficient $D$ of the particle by\n\n$$\nD = \\frac{kT}{\\gamma}.\n$$\n\nIf a marked particle covers a distance $X$ in a given time $t$ (assuming a one-dimensional random walk), the diffusion coefficient is defined to be\n\n$$\nD = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{2t} \\langle \\{ X(t) - X(0) \\}^2 \\rangle,\n$$\n\nwhere the average $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ is taken over an ensemble in thermal equilibrium.\n\nShow that the Einstein relation may be written as\n\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\mu} = \\frac{D}{kT} = \\frac{1}{kT} \\int_0^\\infty \\langle u(t_0) u(t_0 + t) \\rangle \\, dt,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ is known as the mobility of the particle and $t_0$ is any arbitrarily chosen time.\n\n---\n\n15. **Life in one dimension** \n\nA particle lives on the sites of a one-dimensional lattice. At any instant it has probability $\\alpha$ per unit time that it will hop to the site on its right and probability $\\alpha$ per unit time of hopping to the site on its left. \n\nWrite down the master equation for the set of probabilities $p_n(t)$ of finding the particle at the $n^{\\text{th}}$ site, where $-\\infty < n < \\infty$.\n\nSolve the master equation for the $p_n$, subject to the initial condition that the particle was at the site $n = 0$ at time $t = 0$. Hence obtain the mean position $\\langle n \\rangle$ and root mean square deviation from the mean, both as functions of time.\n\n**Hint**: The second part of the question is most easily done by introducing the generating function\n\n$$\nF(z, t) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} p_n(t) z^n.\n$$\n\n---\n\n16. **Master equation**\n\nA system of $N$ atoms, each having two energy levels $E = \\pm \\epsilon$, is brought into contact with a heat bath at temperature $T$. The atoms do not interact with each other, but each atom interacts with the heat bath to have a probability $\\lambda_{-\\to+}(T)$ per unit time of transition from lower to higher level, and a probability $\\lambda_{+\\to-}(T)$ per unit time of the reverse transition.\n\nIf at any time $t$ there are $n_+(t)$ atoms at the higher level and $n_-(t)$ at the lower level, then $n(t) = n_-(t) - n_+(t)$ is a convenient measure of the non-equilibrium state.\n\nObtain the master equation for $n(t)$ and hence the relaxation time $\\tau$ which characterizes the exponential approach of the system to equilibrium.\n\n---\n\n17. **Detailed balance**\n\n**(a)** Starting from the principle of detailed balance for an isolated system, show that for two groups of states within it, $A$ and $B$, the overall rate of transitions from group $A$ to group $B$ is balanced, in equilibrium, by those from $B$ to $A$:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{A \\to B} p^{\\text{eq}}_A = \\lambda_{B \\to A} p^{\\text{eq}}_B\n$$\n\n**(b)** Deduce that the principle applies to microstates in the canonical ensemble, and hence that the jump rates between states of a subsystem (of fixed number of particles) connected to a heat bath must obey\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_{i \\to j}}{\\lambda_{j \\to i}} = e^{-(E_j - E_i)/kT}.\n$$\n\n---\n\n18. **Jump processes**\n\nAn isolated system can occupy three possible states of the same energy. The kinetics are such that it can jump from state 1 to 2 and 2 to 3 but not directly from 1 to 3. Per unit time, there is a probability $\\lambda_0$ that the system makes a jump, from the state it is in, into (each of) the other state(s) it can reach.\n\n**(a)** Show that the occupancy probabilities $p = (p_1, p_2, p_3)$ of the three states obey the master equation\n\n$$\n\\dot{p} = M \\cdot p\n$$\n\nwhere the transition matrix is\n\n$$\nM = \\lambda_0 \\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & -2 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n**(b)** Confirm that an equilibrium state is $p = (1, 1, 1)/3$.\n\n**(c)** Prove this equilibrium state is unique.\n\n**Hint**: For part (c), consider the eigenvalues of $M$.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"live-html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"live-html","base-format":"html","extension-name":"live"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["/Users/phxnw/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/course-disordered-matter/quarto/_extensions/r-wasm/live/live.lua"],"toc":true,"output-file":"problems.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
