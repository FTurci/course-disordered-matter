They consist of particles that are larger than typical molecules but small enough to remain suspended without settling. Examples include milk, fog, and paint.\n\nColloids can be classified based on the state of the **dispersed phase** and the **dispersion medium**. Depending on the particular mixture, one can obtain a wide variety of soft materials, with unique mechanical, optical, and thermal properties.\n\n\n<style>\n.rotate-header {\n    writing-mode: vertical-rl;\n    transform: rotate(-90deg);\n    text-align: center;\n    vertical-align: middle;\n    white-space: nowrap;\n    padding: 1px;\n    width: 0.5em;\n      font-variant: small-caps;\n    letter-spacing: 2px;\n    font-size: 14px;\n    font-family: \"Segoe UI\", sans-serif;\n    line-height: 1.2;\n  }\n  .header {\n    text-align: center;\n    vertical-align: middle;\n    white-space: nowrap;\n    padding: 1px;\n    width: 0.5em;\n      font-variant: small-caps;\n    letter-spacing: 2px;\n    font-size: 14px;\n    font-family: \"Segoe UI\", sans-serif;\n    line-height: 1.2;\n  }\n  table {\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n  }\n  th, td {\n    border: 0px solid black;\n    padding: 4px;\n    vertical-align: top;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th rowspan=\"5\" class=\"rotate-header\">Dispersion Phase</th>\n    <th></th>\n    <th colspan=\"3\" class=\"header\">Dispersion Medium</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th></th>\n    <th>Solid</th>\n    <th>Liquid</th>\n    <th>Gas</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Solid</th>\n    <td><i>Solid suspension:</i><br>pigmented plastics,<br>stained glass,<br>ruby glass, opal, pearl</td>\n    <td><i>Sol, colloidal suspension:</i><br>metal sol,<br>toothpaste, paint,<br>ink, clay slurries, mud</td>\n    <td><i>Solid aerosol:</i><br>smoke, dust</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Liquid</th>\n    <td><i>Solid emulsion:</i><br>bituminous road paving,<br>ice cream</td>\n    <td><i>Emulsion:</i><br>milk, mayonnaise,<br>butter, pharmaceutical creams</td>\n    <td><i>Liquid aerosol:</i><br>fog, mist, tobacco smoke,<br>hair spray</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Gas</th>\n    <td><i>Solid foam:</i><br>zeolites, expanded polystyrene,<br>‘silica gel’</td>\n    <td><i>Foam:</i><br>froths, soap foam,<br>fire-extinguisher foam</td>\n    <td>—</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\nClearly, colloidal materials form an incredibly diverse class, and surround us in our everyday lives. Here are some visual examples from the table above:\n\n![First row: opal, paint, smoke. Middle row: ice-cream (*gelato*), milk, fog. Bottom row: expanded polystyrene and foam. Source: unsplash.com ](figs/colloids.png)\n\n\nThe [IUPAC definition of colloids](https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/C01172) is based on the idea that the particles are dispersed in a medium, creating a *subdivision* at the **colloidal scale**: approximately 1nm to 1µm. \n\n\n\nThe small sizes of colloids means that they are constantly subject to the collisions with the atom/molecules/particle of the medium, triggered by thermal fluctuations. Due to this, the colloids undergo [Brownian motion](../phase-transitions/Brownian-and-Langevin-dynamics.qmd). For each particle, the amount of energy received from the medium is of the order of $k_B T$ (the reference energy scale of thermal soft matter). This energy can be compared with the the potential energy to produce a dimensionless number, the **gravitational Péclet number**\n\n\n $${\\rm Pe}_g = \\dfrac{\\Delta m g R}{k_B T}$$\n\nwhere $R$ is the radius of the colloid respectively,   $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\\Delta m$ is the *buoyant mass*, which for a spherical colloid is expressed as $\\Delta m = \\dfrac{4\\pi}{3}\\Delta\\rho R^3$, with  $\\Delta \\rho$ being the density difference between the particle and the dispersion medium (the *solvent*). We have a colloidal suspension only when ${\\rm Pe}_g \\lesssim 1$, i.e. when Brownian motion is only marginally perturbed by the effects of gravity.\n\n\n## Stability of colloids and colloid-colloid interactions\n\n\nA colloidal dispersion is said to be **stable** if it is able to remain dispersed and Brownian for a long time (typically, significantly longer than the experimental observation time). Unstable colloids undergo aggregation or sedimentation due to the dominance of attractive forces or gravity.\n\nFor example, consider a colloidal suspension like milk. Milk is an emulsion where fat droplets are dispersed in water and stabilised by proteins. If lemon juice (an acid) is added, the dispersion medium (water) changes, the pH drops, and the emulsion is *destabilised*. This causes the proteins to coagulate, leading to the separation of curds (solid) and whey (liquid).\n\n![Curds and whey resulting from the destabilisation of milk, a colloidal emulsion. (Wikimedia)](figs/Curds_and_whey.jpg)\n\nIt is clear from this example that the nature of the dispersed phase and the dispersed medium ultimately determine the stability of colloidal dispersions. What ultimately matters for the stability is whether the colloids have a propensity to aggregate or not. This propensity is quantified in terms of **colloidal interactions**.\n\n### Fundamental and effective forces\n\nAt the colloidal scales, only two kinds of fundamental forces are relevant: gravity and electro (and occasionally magneto) static forces. As we have seen above, when a system is truly colloidal, gravitational contributions are assumed to be small, so in effect for a non magnetic colloid (which is the vast majority of colloidal systems) only electrostatic forces are fundamentally important.\n\nHowever, colloidal dispersions consist of large particles carrying many charges both in the dispersed phase and the surrounding medium, arranged disorderly at the atomic scale. This makes a microscopic description of all charges and the resulting electrostatic fields not only unfeasible but also ineffective for understanding colloidal systems in terms of key characteristics such as particle size, density, and spatial distribution. The fundamental issue is the one of time-scales: the motion of colloids is much slower than the motion of individual ions or molecules. Over such longer timescales, many interactions at the **microscopic** atomistic scale take place and we can think of taking averages to extract **macroscopic**, **effective** interactions at the colloidal scale [^1]. \n\n[^1]: This is clearly an instance of the idea of **coarse graining **that we have introduced [earlier](soft-matter_intro.qmd).\n\n\nThere are amny examples of such effective forces [@lekkerkerker2024colloids]. One you may already know is the Van der Waals interaction. For colloids, we have additional relevant forces, such as the double layer interaction and the depletion interaction. We detail them here below.\n\n### Van der Waals interaction\n\nThe London-van der Waals **dispersion forces** arise from the interaction between **instantaneous dipoles** in overall neutral atoms or molecules. In simple terms, the idea is that \nAt any given moment, the electrons in an atom or molecule are not symmetrically distributed, creating a temporary dipole. Such instantaneous dipole induces a dipole in a neighboring atom or molecule by distorting its electron cloud.\n\nThe interaction energy between two dipoles $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ separated by a distance $r$ is proportional to:\n$$\nU \\propto -\\frac{\\mu_1 \\mu_2}{r^3}\n$$\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![Johannes Diderik van der Waals (1837-1923), who hypothesised the existence of forces responsible for the non-ideal behaviour of gases](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Johannes_Diderik_van_der_Waals.jpg/960px-Johannes_Diderik_van_der_Waals.jpg){width=150 fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n![Left: Hugo C.

The average interaction energy is derived using perturbation theory and is proportional to the polarisabilities $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ of the two particles:\n$$\n    U(r) = -\\frac{C}{r^6}\n$$\n\nwhere $C \\propto \\alpha_1 \\alpha_2$ depends on the polarisabilities and ionization energies of the particles.\n\nThe resulting $r^{-6}$ dependence is also referred to as the **London dispersion force**. \n\nWe can then assume to take two identical spherical colloids of radius $R$ at distance $h$ and that every volume element of such spheres interacts with the London disperison force (see the semi-classical approach of Hamaker @hamaker1937london for illustration). Integrating over all volume elements yields the collodial spheres **Van der Waals attractive potential** in the form\n\n$$W_{wdW}(h)=-\\dfrac{A-H}{g}f(h/R)$$\n\nwhere $A_H$ is the **Hamaker constant** and $f(h/R)$ is \n\n$$f(h/R) = \\left[ \\frac{2R^2}{h^2 - 4R^2} + \\frac{2R^2}{h^2} + \\ln\\left( \\frac{h^2 - 4R^2}{h^2} \\right) \\right]$$\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Sketch of a derivation of colloid-coilloid Van der Waals potential \n\nEach volume element in one sphere interacts with each in the other sphere via:\n\n$$\n\\phi(r) = -\\frac{C}{r^6}\n$$\n\nSo the total interaction energy is:\n\n$$\nU(h) = -C \\iint \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2|^6} \\, dV_1 \\, dV_2\n$$\n\nLet:\n\n* Sphere 1 be centered at $(0, 0, 0)$,\n* Sphere 2 be centered at $(0, 0, h)$,\n* $\\mathbf{r}_1 = \\mathbf{r}$, $\\mathbf{r}_2 = \\mathbf{r}'$\n\nThen $|\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2| = |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}'|$, and the integral becomes:\n\n$$\nU(h) = -C \\iiint_{|\\mathbf{r}| \\leq R} \\iiint_{|\\mathbf{r}' - h\\hat{z}| \\leq R} \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}'|^6} \\, d^3\\mathbf{r} \\, d^3\\mathbf{r}'\n$$\n\n\n\nHamaker evaluated this by integrating over the **densities of interacting atoms** with number density $\\rho$ in both spheres.

We found that $\\left\\langle r^{2}\\right\\rangle=N b^{2}$, which suggests $\\left\\langle\\underline{r}^{2}\\right\\rangle \\propto t$.\n\nNow we are interested in many particles, where each undergoes a random walk and is not influenced by the others. We then ask: What fraction will be in a certain volume element after time $t$ ? This is the process of diffusion, e.g. spread of a drop of colour ink in water.\n\nMathematics: Suppose that the distribution of particles $n(x, t)$ is not uniform. This nonequilibrium situation will lead to a motion of particles (diffusion) tending to increase entropy and restore a homogeneous concentration.\nWe are interested in the time-dependent concentration (number per unit volume) profile of particles $n(x, t)$. In the case of an initially very narrow spatial distribution of particles this will correspond to the probability of any particle having moved to $x$.\nThe mean number of particles crossing unit area of a plane (perpendicular to the $x$-axis) per unit time (i.e. the 'flux'), is denoted by $J_{x}$. This flux is expected to be (to a good approximation) proportional to the concentration gradient:\n\n$$\nJ(x, t)=-D \\frac{\\partial n(x, t)}{\\partial x} \\quad \\text { Fick's law }\n$$\n\nwhere the diffusion constant (or coefficient) $D$ has been defined as the constant of proportionality\n\nNow, conservation of particle number demands\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(n(x, t) A d x)=A J_{x}(x, t)-A J_{x}(x+d x, t) \\\\\n& \\text { Flux in .................

Hence\n\n$$\np(x, t) d x=\\frac{A d x n(x, t)}{N_{\\text {tot }}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D t}} \\exp \\left(-x^{2} / 4 D t\\right) d x\n$$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-12.jpg?height=972&width=722&top_left_y=327&top_left_x=271)\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-12.jpg?height=1004&width=762&top_left_y=338&top_left_x=1034)\n\nBut the spreading of the particle distribution with time is due to the random walk of individual particles, for which we already have an equation (1-D):\n\n$$\np_{N}(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi<(\\Delta x)^{2}>}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{(x-<x>)^{2}}{2<(\\Delta x)^{2}>}\\right)\n$$\n\nComparing the result from the two points of view and setting $\\langle x\\rangle=0$, we get\n$<\\Delta x^{2}>=2 D t$\nAs expected the mean square displacement increases linearly with time, but we have now found the constant of proportionality: $2 D$.\nGeneralisation to three dimensions yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nJ=-D \\nabla n(\\underline{r}, t) & \\text { Fick's law } \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t}=-\\nabla \\cdot \\underline{J} & \\text { Particle conservation } \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t}=D \\nabla^{2} n & \\text { Diffusion equation } \\\\\n\\left\\langle\\underline{r}^{2}\\right\\rangle=6 D t & \\text { Mean square displacement }\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThis last relation could constitute an alternative definition of the diffusion coefficient, instead of Fick's law.\n\n### Stokes-Einstein relation\n\nSuppose that the particles are subjected to an external force F in the x direction, e.g. gravity. In thermal equilibrium the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is valid, i.e. the particle density $n(x)$ is given by\n\n$$\nn(x)=n_{0} \\exp \\left(-U(x) / k_{B} T\\right)=n_{0} \\exp \\left(-F x / k_{B} T\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere we assumed a constant force $F$ in the last equation. In the case of gravity $F=m_{B} g$ with $m_{B}$ the buoyant mass. $n(x)$ results from the balance between the motion of the particles due to the external force setting up a concentration gradient, and the resultant diffusion given by Fick's law.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-13.jpg?height=291&width=619&top_left_y=1597&top_left_x=466)\n\nIn the case of gravity, this leads to a sedimentation equilibrium.\n(a) Flux due to external force, $J_{F}$\n\nThe velocity of a particle under an applied force $F$ in a viscous fluid can be written as $v=$ $F / \\xi$ which defines the friction coefficient $\\xi$. Hence\n\n$$\nJ_{F}=n(x) v=\\frac{n(x) F}{\\xi}\n$$\n\n(b) Diffusive flux, $J_{D}$\n$J_{D}$ is given by Fick's Law (see above):\n\n$$\nJ_{D}(x)=-D \\frac{\\partial n(x)}{\\partial x}\n$$\n\nEquating the two fluxes $J_{F}=J_{D}$ we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{n(x) F}{\\xi}=-D \\frac{\\partial n(x)}{d x}=+D \\frac{F}{k_{B} T} n(x)\n$$\n\nThe second equation is obtained by differentiating the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This gives the relation between the diffusion and friction coefficients:\n\n$$\nD=\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\xi}=\\frac{k_{B} T}{6 \\pi \\eta R}\n$$\n\nThe last equation applies to a spherical particle of radius $R$ in a fluid of viscosity $\\eta$, for which Stokes's Law gives $\\xi=6 \\pi \\eta R$ (which applies only at low Reynold's number, $\\rho R v / \\eta$ $\\ll 1$ ) resulting in the Stokes-Einstein relation.\n\n- The Stokes-Einstein relation is a very deep result. It relates equilibrium fluctuations in a system to the energy dissipation when the system is driven off equilibrium. Here, the fluctuations in the fluid give rise to the diffusive motion of the suspended particle and $D$ is therefore the 'fluctuation' part. A sheared fluid will dissipate energy because of its finite viscosity and thus $\\eta$ represents the dissipative part.\n- More generally, Brownian motion sets a natural limit to the precision of physical measurements. Example: A mirror suspended on a torsion fibre reflects a spot of light onto a scale. The spot will jiggle due to the random impact of air molecules and the random motion of atoms in the quartz fibre. To reduce the jiggle, the apparatus has to be cooled. The relation between fluctuation and dissipation tells us where to cool. 'This depends upon where [the mirror] is getting its 'kicks' from. If it is through the fibre, we cool it ... if the mirror is surrounded by a gas and is getting hit mostly by collisions in the gas, it is better to cool the gas. As a matter of fact, if we know where the damping of the oscillations comes from, it turns out that that is always the source of the fluctuations.' (Feynman, Chapter 41)\n\n\n### Interacting colloidal particles\n\nSo far we have dealt with colloidal particles as independent spheres suspended in a medium. Now we will study concentrated suspensions in which interparticle interactions cannot be ignored.\n\n####  Samples: model hard-sphere colloids\n\nTo be specific let us discuss a monodisperse colloid made up of polymethyl-\nmethacrylate (PMMA; perspex in bulk form) spheres, which are covered with polymeric hairs (Poly-hydroxystearic acid) to stop them sticking to each other. They show to a very good approximation hard sphere behaviour.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-15.jpg?height=315&width=684&top_left_y=718&top_left_x=1138)\n\nThe radius of the colloid is typically $R \\leq 0.5 \\mu m$ with a very small polydispersity (size variation) of $\\Delta R / R<0.05$.\nThe usual way of referring to particle densities is the 'volume fraction' $\\phi$, defined to be the fraction of the suspension occupied by particles. If we have $N$ monodisperse spheres with radius $R$ in the total volume $V$, then\n\n$$\n\\phi=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{part}}}{V}=\\frac{N}{V} \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^{3}\n$$\n\n#### Phase Behaviour\n\nAs a reminder we first look at the interaction potential and phase behaviour of a simple atomic substance, such as argon. A generic inter-particle potential $U(r)$ exhibits the infinite hard sphere repulsion as well as an attractive part of depth $\\varepsilon$. The\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-15.jpg?height=562&width=893&top_left_y=1971&top_left_x=277)\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-15.jpg?height=570&width=581&top_left_y=1973&top_left_x=1225)\ncorresponding generic phase diagram in the temperature-density plane shows the regions where gas, liquid, fluid and crystal exist. A rough estimate of the critical temperature $T_{C}$ is given by $k_{B} T_{C} \\sim \\varepsilon$. If $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$, as in the case of hard spheres, we expect that there will be no critical point and therefore no liquid phase. This is indeed the case.\n\n#### Phase behaviour of hard-sphere colloids:\n\nAt very low densities, the structure of a hard-sphere suspension is like that of a perfect gas; the positions of the colloidal particles are practically uncorrelated and the chance of finding a particle in any particular vicinity is almost independent of the presence of all the other particles.\n\nUpon an increase in particle density, their positions begin to become correlated as the\nparticles are mutually excluding. If we look inside a suspension of volume fraction $\\phi \\geq 0.3$, then we will find that, at any one instant, each particle is surrounded by a `cage' of neighbours (short-ranged order). The cage tightens as $\\phi$ increases. The cage size\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-16.jpg?height=394&width=354&top_left_y=1082&top_left_x=1273) represents a dominant length scale in the system.\nDespite the appearance of correlations between particle positions, a hard-sphere suspension below $\\phi \\lesssim 0.5$ is still in what one might call a 'colloid fluid' phase, i.e. the arrangement of particles in such a suspension is analogous to the arrangement of atoms in an atomic fluid (e.g. fluid argon) - on average the particle centres are more or\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-16.jpg?height=492&width=825&top_left_y=1966&top_left_x=257)\nless randomly arranged, and each particle can, given time, wander through the available volume. The structure is described by the radial distribution function $g(r)$. Given a particle centred at $\\underline{r}=0$, $(N / V) g(\\underline{r}) d \\underline{r}$ is the number of particles in $d \\underline{r}$ at a distance $\\underline{r}$.\n\nIf we increase the volume fraction above $\\phi \\approx 0.55$, however, a phase transition occurs. The particles will spontaneously pack into a crystalline arrangement. Particles now can only move round about their average lattice site, but will not wander throughout the available volume. This phase is called a 'colloidal crystal'. Due to more local freedom the crystal has a higher (!) entropy than the metastable fluid from which it grows. It is an entropically-driven phase transition. Between $\\phi=0.5$ and $\\phi=0.55$, we find coexistence between colloidal fluid and crystal.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-17.jpg?height=624&width=1364&top_left_y=680&top_left_x=359)\n\nNote that no colloidal liquid is formed ( $T_{\\mathcal{C}}=0$ ), as expected for an interaction potential without attraction.\nAt the highest particle concentrations (above $\\phi \\approx 0.58$ ) crystallization may be avoided if the temperature is quenched very rapidly, and a colloidal glass is formed. We will return to study the behaviour of glasses in Part 4.\n\n### Particle dynamics\n\n#### Hard-spheres\n\nWe are interested in the mean-square displacement $\\left\\langle\\underline{r}^{2}(t)\\right\\rangle$ as a function of time for different volume fractions. At low volume fractions, the particles undergo Brownian motion (random-walk diffusion) due to collisions with liquid molecules. The meansquare displacement $\\left\\langle\\underline{r}^{2}(t)\\right\\rangle=6 D_{0} t$ as already seen earlier.\nAbove $\\phi \\sim 0.3$, however, different regimes are observed. At short times the particles diffuse with the short time (self) diffusion constant $D_{s}$. This is determined from the\nshort time limit and is smaller than the $D_{0}$ measured for $\\phi \\rightarrow 0$. The motion of the particles (self diffusion) is still driven by collisions with the liquid molecules, but in addition the interactions between particles become significant. While the particles are diffusing in their cages formed by their neighbours, the hydrodynamic interaction\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-18.jpg?height=391&width=432&top_left_y=368&top_left_x=1351)\nwith the neighbours, transmitted through flows in the liquid, causes slowing down relative to the free diffusion at low concentrations. At intermediate times the particles encounter the neighbours and the interactions slow the motion down. To make further progress, the particle has to break out of the cage formed by its neighbours. Now the particles experience a further interaction, direct interactions (hard-sphere interactions), in addition to the hydrodynamic interactions. The long-time and long-ranged movement is also diffusive, i.e. we still have $\\left\\langle\\underline{r}^{2}(t)>\\propto t\\right.$, when the particles undergo large-scale random-walk diffusion through many cages. However, the motion is further slowed and a smaller diffusion constant relative to the motion in the short time limit is observed, the long time (self) diffusion constant $D_{L}$.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-19.jpg?height=777&width=1086&top_left_y=868&top_left_x=539)\nshort time:\n$<r^{2}(t)>=6 D_{S} t$\nshort-time self diff. coeff.\n$D_{S}<D_{0}$ purely because of hydrodyn. interactions\ntheoretical predictions exist\nintermediate time:\nsome theory\nlong time:\n$<r^{2}(t)>=6 D_{L} t$\nlong-time self diff. coeff.\n$D_{L}<D_{S}\\left(<D_{0}\\right)$ because of hydrodyn. and direct interactions\ntheory very complicated, but some predictions exist\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{pyodide}\n#| echo: false\n#| autorun: true\n# modifying the path to add the code folder\nimport sys\nprint(sys.path)\nsys.path.insert(0, 'src/')\nprint(sys.path)\n```\n\n## Kinds of colloids\n\nColloids are mixtures where one substance is dispersed throughout another. They consist of particles that are larger than typical molecules but small enough to remain suspended without settling. Examples include milk, fog, and paint.\n\nColloids can be classified based on the state of the **dispersed phase** and the **dispersion medium**. Depending on the particular mixture, one can obtain a wide variety of soft materials, with unique mechanical, optical, and thermal properties.\n\n\n<style>\n.rotate-header {\n    writing-mode: vertical-rl;\n    transform: rotate(-90deg);\n    text-align: center;\n    vertical-align: middle;\n    white-space: nowrap;\n    padding: 1px;\n    width: 0.5em;\n      font-variant: small-caps;\n    letter-spacing: 2px;\n    font-size: 14px;\n    font-family: \"Segoe UI\", sans-serif;\n    line-height: 1.2;\n  }\n  .header {\n    text-align: center;\n    vertical-align: middle;\n    white-space: nowrap;\n    padding: 1px;\n    width: 0.5em;\n      font-variant: small-caps;\n    letter-spacing: 2px;\n    font-size: 14px;\n    font-family: \"Segoe UI\", sans-serif;\n    line-height: 1.2;\n  }\n  table {\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n  }\n  th, td {\n    border: 0px solid black;\n    padding: 4px;\n    vertical-align: top;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th rowspan=\"5\" class=\"rotate-header\">Dispersion Phase</th>\n    <th></th>\n    <th colspan=\"3\" class=\"header\">Dispersion Medium</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th></th>\n    <th>Solid</th>\n    <th>Liquid</th>\n    <th>Gas</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Solid</th>\n    <td><i>Solid suspension:</i><br>pigmented plastics,<br>stained glass,<br>ruby glass, opal, pearl</td>\n    <td><i>Sol, colloidal suspension:</i><br>metal sol,<br>toothpaste, paint,<br>ink, clay slurries, mud</td>\n    <td><i>Solid aerosol:</i><br>smoke, dust</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Liquid</th>\n    <td><i>Solid emulsion:</i><br>bituminous road paving,<br>ice cream</td>\n    <td><i>Emulsion:</i><br>milk, mayonnaise,<br>butter, pharmaceutical creams</td>\n    <td><i>Liquid aerosol:</i><br>fog, mist, tobacco smoke,<br>hair spray</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Gas</th>\n    <td><i>Solid foam:</i><br>zeolites, expanded polystyrene,<br>‘silica gel’</td>\n    <td><i>Foam:</i><br>froths, soap foam,<br>fire-extinguisher foam</td>\n    <td>—</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\nClearly, colloidal materials form an incredibly diverse class, and surround us in our everyday lives. Here are some visual examples from the table above:\n\n![First row: opal, paint, smoke. Middle row: ice-cream (*gelato*), milk, fog. Bottom row: expanded polystyrene and foam. Source: unsplash.com ](figs/colloids.png)\n\n\nThe [IUPAC definition of colloids](https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/C01172) is based on the idea that the particles are dispersed in a medium, creating a *subdivision* at the **colloidal scale**: approximately 1nm to 1µm. \n\n\n\nThe small sizes of colloids means that they are constantly subject to the collisions with the atom/molecules/particle of the medium, triggered by thermal fluctuations. Due to this, the colloids undergo [Brownian motion](../phase-transitions/Brownian-and-Langevin-dynamics.qmd). For each particle, the amount of energy received from the medium is of the order of $k_B T$ (the reference energy scale of thermal soft matter). This energy can be compared with the the potential energy to produce a dimensionless number, the **gravitational Péclet number**\n\n\n $${\\rm Pe}_g = \\dfrac{\\Delta m g R}{k_B T}$$\n\nwhere $R$ is the radius of the colloid respectively,   $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\\Delta m$ is the *buoyant mass*, which for a spherical colloid is expressed as $\\Delta m = \\dfrac{4\\pi}{3}\\Delta\\rho R^3$, with  $\\Delta \\rho$ being the density difference between the particle and the dispersion medium (the *solvent*). We have a colloidal suspension only when ${\\rm Pe}_g \\lesssim 1$, i.e. when Brownian motion is only marginally perturbed by the effects of gravity.\n\n\n## Stability of colloids and colloid-colloid interactions\n\n\nA colloidal dispersion is said to be **stable** if it is able to remain dispersed and Brownian for a long time (typically, significantly longer than the experimental observation time). Unstable colloids undergo aggregation or sedimentation due to the dominance of attractive forces or gravity.\n\nFor example, consider a colloidal suspension like milk. Milk is an emulsion where fat droplets are dispersed in water and stabilised by proteins. If lemon juice (an acid) is added, the dispersion medium (water) changes, the pH drops, and the emulsion is *destabilised*. This causes the proteins to coagulate, leading to the separation of curds (solid) and whey (liquid).\n\n![Curds and whey resulting from the destabilisation of milk, a colloidal emulsion. (Wikimedia)](figs/Curds_and_whey.jpg)\n\nIt is clear from this example that the nature of the dispersed phase and the dispersed medium ultimately determine the stability of colloidal dispersions. What ultimately matters for the stability is whether the colloids have a propensity to aggregate or not. This propensity is quantified in terms of **colloidal interactions**.\n\n### Fundamental and effective forces\n\nAt the colloidal scales, only two kinds of fundamental forces are relevant: gravity and electro (and occasionally magneto) static forces. As we have seen above, when a system is truly colloidal, gravitational contributions are assumed to be small, so in effect for a non magnetic colloid (which is the vast majority of colloidal systems) only electrostatic forces are fundamentally important.\n\nHowever, colloidal dispersions consist of large particles carrying many charges both in the dispersed phase and the surrounding medium, arranged disorderly at the atomic scale. This makes a microscopic description of all charges and the resulting electrostatic fields not only unfeasible but also ineffective for understanding colloidal systems in terms of key characteristics such as particle size, density, and spatial distribution. The fundamental issue is the one of time-scales: the motion of colloids is much slower than the motion of individual ions or molecules. Over such longer timescales, many interactions at the **microscopic** atomistic scale take place and we can think of taking averages to extract **macroscopic**, **effective** interactions at the colloidal scale [^1]. \n\n[^1]: This is clearly an instance of the idea of **coarse graining **that we have introduced [earlier](soft-matter_intro.qmd).\n\n\nThere are amny examples of such effective forces [@lekkerkerker2024colloids]. One you may already know is the Van der Waals interaction. For colloids, we have additional relevant forces, such as the double layer interaction and the depletion interaction. We detail them here below.\n\n### Van der Waals interaction\n\nThe London-van der Waals **dispersion forces** arise from the interaction between **instantaneous dipoles** in overall neutral atoms or molecules. In simple terms, the idea is that \nAt any given moment, the electrons in an atom or molecule are not symmetrically distributed, creating a temporary dipole. Such instantaneous dipole induces a dipole in a neighboring atom or molecule by distorting its electron cloud.\n\nThe interaction energy between two dipoles $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ separated by a distance $r$ is proportional to:\n$$\nU \\propto -\\frac{\\mu_1 \\mu_2}{r^3}\n$$\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![Johannes Diderik van der Waals (1837-1923), who hypothesised the existence of forces responsible for the non-ideal behaviour of gases](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Johannes_Diderik_van_der_Waals.jpg/960px-Johannes_Diderik_van_der_Waals.jpg){width=150 fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n![Left: Hugo C.

The average interaction energy is derived using perturbation theory and is proportional to the polarisabilities $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ of the two particles:\n$$\n    U(r) = -\\frac{C}{r^6}\n$$\n\nwhere $C \\propto \\alpha_1 \\alpha_2$ depends on the polarisabilities and ionization energies of the particles.\n\nThe resulting $r^{-6}$ dependence is also referred to as the **London dispersion force**. \n\nWe can then assume to take two identical spherical colloids of radius $R$ at distance $h$ and that every volume element of such spheres interacts with the London disperison force (see the semi-classical approach of Hamaker @hamaker1937london for illustration).

We found that $\\left\\langle r^{2}\\right\\rangle=N b^{2}$, which suggests $\\left\\langle\\underline{r}^{2}\\right\\rangle \\propto t$.\n\nNow we are interested in many particles, where each undergoes a random walk and is not influenced by the others. We then ask: What fraction will be in a certain volume element after time $t$ ? This is the process of diffusion, e.g. spread of a drop of colour ink in water.\n\nMathematics: Suppose that the distribution of particles $n(x, t)$ is not uniform. This nonequilibrium situation will lead to a motion of particles (diffusion) tending to increase entropy and restore a homogeneous concentration.\nWe are interested in the time-dependent concentration (number per unit volume) profile of particles $n(x, t)$. In the case of an initially very narrow spatial distribution of particles this will correspond to the probability of any particle having moved to $x$.\nThe mean number of particles crossing unit area of a plane (perpendicular to the $x$-axis) per unit time (i.e. the 'flux'), is denoted by $J_{x}$. This flux is expected to be (to a good approximation) proportional to the concentration gradient:\n\n$$\nJ(x, t)=-D \\frac{\\partial n(x, t)}{\\partial x} \\quad \\text { Fick's law }\n$$\n\nwhere the diffusion constant (or coefficient) $D$ has been defined as the constant of proportionality\n\nNow, conservation of particle number demands\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(n(x, t) A d x)=A J_{x}(x, t)-A J_{x}(x+d x, t) \\\\\n& \\text { Flux in .................

In thermal equilibrium the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is valid, i.e. the particle density $n(x)$ is given by\n\n$$\nn(x)=n_{0} \\exp \\left(-U(x) / k_{B} T\\right)=n_{0} \\exp \\left(-F x / k_{B} T\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere we assumed a constant force $F$ in the last equation. In the case of gravity $F=m_{B} g$ with $m_{B}$ the buoyant mass. $n(x)$ results from the balance between the motion of the particles due to the external force setting up a concentration gradient, and the resultant diffusion given by Fick's law.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-13.jpg?height=291&width=619&top_left_y=1597&top_left_x=466)\n\nIn the case of gravity, this leads to a sedimentation equilibrium.\n(a) Flux due to external force, $J_{F}$\n\nThe velocity of a particle under an applied force $F$ in a viscous fluid can be written as $v=$ $F / \\xi$ which defines the friction coefficient $\\xi$. Hence\n\n$$\nJ_{F}=n(x) v=\\frac{n(x) F}{\\xi}\n$$\n\n(b) Diffusive flux, $J_{D}$\n$J_{D}$ is given by Fick's Law (see above):\n\n$$\nJ_{D}(x)=-D \\frac{\\partial n(x)}{\\partial x}\n$$\n\nEquating the two fluxes $J_{F}=J_{D}$ we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{n(x) F}{\\xi}=-D \\frac{\\partial n(x)}{d x}=+D \\frac{F}{k_{B} T} n(x)\n$$\n\nThe second equation is obtained by differentiating the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This gives the relation between the diffusion and friction coefficients:\n\n$$\nD=\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\xi}=\\frac{k_{B} T}{6 \\pi \\eta R}\n$$\n\nThe last equation applies to a spherical particle of radius $R$ in a fluid of viscosity $\\eta$, for which Stokes's Law gives $\\xi=6 \\pi \\eta R$ (which applies only at low Reynold's number, $\\rho R v / \\eta$ $\\ll 1$ ) resulting in the Stokes-Einstein relation.\n\n- The Stokes-Einstein relation is a very deep result. It relates equilibrium fluctuations in a system to the energy dissipation when the system is driven off equilibrium. Here, the fluctuations in the fluid give rise to the diffusive motion of the suspended particle and $D$ is therefore the 'fluctuation' part. A sheared fluid will dissipate energy because of its finite viscosity and thus $\\eta$ represents the dissipative part.\n- More generally, Brownian motion sets a natural limit to the precision of physical measurements. Example: A mirror suspended on a torsion fibre reflects a spot of light onto a scale. The spot will jiggle due to the random impact of air molecules and the random motion of atoms in the quartz fibre. To reduce the jiggle, the apparatus has to be cooled. The relation between fluctuation and dissipation tells us where to cool. 'This depends upon where [the mirror] is getting its 'kicks' from. If it is through the fibre, we cool it ... if the mirror is surrounded by a gas and is getting hit mostly by collisions in the gas, it is better to cool the gas. As a matter of fact, if we know where the damping of the oscillations comes from, it turns out that that is always the source of the fluctuations.' (Feynman, Chapter 41)\n\n\n### Interacting colloidal particles\n\nSo far we have dealt with colloidal particles as independent spheres suspended in a medium. Now we will study concentrated suspensions in which interparticle interactions cannot be ignored.\n\n####  Samples: model hard-sphere colloids\n\nTo be specific let us discuss a monodisperse colloid made up of polymethyl-\nmethacrylate (PMMA; perspex in bulk form) spheres, which are covered with polymeric hairs (Poly-hydroxystearic acid) to stop them sticking to each other. They show to a very good approximation hard sphere behaviour.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-15.jpg?height=315&width=684&top_left_y=718&top_left_x=1138)\n\nThe radius of the colloid is typically $R \\leq 0.5 \\mu m$ with a very small polydispersity (size variation) of $\\Delta R / R<0.05$.\nThe usual way of referring to particle densities is the 'volume fraction' $\\phi$, defined to be the fraction of the suspension occupied by particles. If we have $N$ monodisperse spheres with radius $R$ in the total volume $V$, then\n\n$$\n\\phi=\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{part}}}{V}=\\frac{N}{V} \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^{3}\n$$\n\n#### Phase Behaviour\n\nAs a reminder we first look at the interaction potential and phase behaviour of a simple atomic substance, such as argon. A generic inter-particle potential $U(r)$ exhibits the infinite hard sphere repulsion as well as an attractive part of depth $\\varepsilon$. The\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-15.jpg?height=562&width=893&top_left_y=1971&top_left_x=277)\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-15.jpg?height=570&width=581&top_left_y=1973&top_left_x=1225)\ncorresponding generic phase diagram in the temperature-density plane shows the regions where gas, liquid, fluid and crystal exist. A rough estimate of the critical temperature $T_{C}$ is given by $k_{B} T_{C} \\sim \\varepsilon$. If $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$, as in the case of hard spheres, we expect that there will be no critical point and therefore no liquid phase. This is indeed the case.\n\n#### Phase behaviour of hard-sphere colloids:\n\nAt very low densities, the structure of a hard-sphere suspension is like that of a perfect gas; the positions of the colloidal particles are practically uncorrelated and the chance of finding a particle in any particular vicinity is almost independent of the presence of all the other particles.\n\nUpon an increase in particle density, their positions begin to become correlated as the\nparticles are mutually excluding. If we look inside a suspension of volume fraction $\\phi \\geq 0.3$, then we will find that, at any one instant, each particle is surrounded by a `cage' of neighbours (short-ranged order). The cage tightens as $\\phi$ increases. The cage size\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-16.jpg?height=394&width=354&top_left_y=1082&top_left_x=1273) represents a dominant length scale in the system.\nDespite the appearance of correlations between particle positions, a hard-sphere suspension below $\\phi \\lesssim 0.5$ is still in what one might call a 'colloid fluid' phase, i.e. the arrangement of particles in such a suspension is analogous to the arrangement of atoms in an atomic fluid (e.g. fluid argon) - on average the particle centres are more or\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-16.jpg?height=492&width=825&top_left_y=1966&top_left_x=257)\nless randomly arranged, and each particle can, given time, wander through the available volume. The structure is described by the radial distribution function $g(r)$. Given a particle centred at $\\underline{r}=0$, $(N / V) g(\\underline{r}) d \\underline{r}$ is the number of particles in $d \\underline{r}$ at a distance $\\underline{r}$.\n\nIf we increase the volume fraction above $\\phi \\approx 0.55$, however, a phase transition occurs. The particles will spontaneously pack into a crystalline arrangement. Particles now can only move round about their average lattice site, but will not wander throughout the available volume. This phase is called a 'colloidal crystal'. Due to more local freedom the crystal has a higher (!) entropy than the metastable fluid from which it grows. It is an entropically-driven phase transition. Between $\\phi=0.5$ and $\\phi=0.55$, we find coexistence between colloidal fluid and crystal.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-17.jpg?height=624&width=1364&top_left_y=680&top_left_x=359)\n\nNote that no colloidal liquid is formed ( $T_{\\mathcal{C}}=0$ ), as expected for an interaction potential without attraction.\nAt the highest particle concentrations (above $\\phi \\approx 0.58$ ) crystallization may be avoided if the temperature is quenched very rapidly, and a colloidal glass is formed. We will return to study the behaviour of glasses in Part 4.\n\n### Particle dynamics\n\n#### Hard-spheres\n\nWe are interested in the mean-square displacement $\\left\\langle\\underline{r}^{2}(t)\\right\\rangle$ as a function of time for different volume fractions. At low volume fractions, the particles undergo Brownian motion (random-walk diffusion) due to collisions with liquid molecules. The meansquare displacement $\\left\\langle\\underline{r}^{2}(t)\\right\\rangle=6 D_{0} t$ as already seen earlier.\nAbove $\\phi \\sim 0.3$, however, different regimes are observed. At short times the particles diffuse with the short time (self) diffusion constant $D_{s}$. This is determined from the\nshort time limit and is smaller than the $D_{0}$ measured for $\\phi \\rightarrow 0$. The motion of the particles (self diffusion) is still driven by collisions with the liquid molecules, but in addition the interactions between particles become significant. While the particles are diffusing in their cages formed by their neighbours, the hydrodynamic interaction\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-18.jpg?height=391&width=432&top_left_y=368&top_left_x=1351)\nwith the neighbours, transmitted through flows in the liquid, causes slowing down relative to the free diffusion at low concentrations. At intermediate times the particles encounter the neighbours and the interactions slow the motion down. To make further progress, the particle has to break out of the cage formed by its neighbours. Now the particles experience a further interaction, direct interactions (hard-sphere interactions), in addition to the hydrodynamic interactions. The long-time and long-ranged movement is also diffusive, i.e. we still have $\\left\\langle\\underline{r}^{2}(t)>\\propto t\\right.$, when the particles undergo large-scale random-walk diffusion through many cages. However, the motion is further slowed and a smaller diffusion constant relative to the motion in the short time limit is observed, the long time (self) diffusion constant $D_{L}$.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-19.jpg?height=777&width=1086&top_left_y=868&top_left_x=539)\nshort time:\n$<r^{2}(t)>=6 D_{S} t$\nshort-time self diff.
