        "In the theory part of the course you have been introduced formally to the radial distribution function $g(r)$ and seen how it is a useful description of the arrangement of particles in a disordered system. In particular, in the absence of the long range periodic order that is associated with crystalline materials it is one of the first things we wish to find for liquid or glassy material. In our examples we assume that we are looking at a uniform and isotropic material, that is, there is no preferred direction in the material and no density variations on length scales much greater than the particle size. That is macorscopically the material appears is of uniform density. It is also possible to give a more general definition $g(\\bf{r})$ where we recognise that there is some preferred orientation of the atoms around each other in the material but we will not consider it here.\n",

        "## A simple description of $g(r)$\n",
        "\n",
        "In layman's terms the radial distribution function is often described loosely as the $\\it{probabilty~of~finding~another~particle~at~a~distance~ ~from~a~particle~at~the~origin}$.  If we think about it this way we must remember that $g(r)$ is a statistical function so what we are really trying to express is the average of this distribution taking each atom in the material in turn as the 'origin'. Expressed in this way you might worry about what this means for atoms on the 'edge'. Normally this is not a concern for large samples, but beware  about the definition of $g(r)$if you start approaching 'nano-crystalline' materials.\n",
        "\n",
        "A better definition is that $g(r)$ represents the deviation from the mean particle density, normalised to one, as you move outward from a particle at the origin. At large $r$ we expect this to equate to a constant related to the mean particle density of the material. When properly normalised to the mean density $g(r) _{r\\rightarrow \\infty} \\rightarrow 1$. The figure below shows the key features of a typical radial distribution function.\n",

        "- that $g(r) = 0$ for a distance below a 'cutoff' distance. This recognises that our particles have a finite size and when we mean 'position of particle' we mean its centre. Hence this cut off represents the diameter of the particles. What we mean by diameter of particle and what this means for $g(r)$ we will discuss shortly.\n",
        "- $g(r)$ typically rises from 0 to give a 'first peak'. The position of this peak is referred to as the nearest neighbour distance. (NB. it is not the same as the diameter of the particles).\n",
        "- After the nearest neighbour peak, $g(r)$ typically dips below the mean density and is characterised by damped oscillating peaks and troughs until $g(r)$ reaches the constant mean density.\n",

        "\n",
        "The peaks observed in $g(r)$ correspond to the most common interparticle seperation. For an atomic system, they can typically be associated with chemical bonds and as you move further in $r$ the $\\it{medium}$ range ordering. However, we must remember that this is only a pair corrrelation function. It does not $\\it{per~se}$ tell us about for example bond angles. These are formally be obtained from higher order correlation functionz (triplet, ...) but these are not obtainable directly from $g(r)$ itself.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Note. If we have a crystalline material the peaks in $g(r)$ will be narrow (they will have an intrinsic width at least due to therml vibration) and at low $r$, $g(r)$ will be zero between them. However, even in a crystalline material these peaks will start to broaden and get smaller at high $r$ until, again, $g(r)$ reaches mean density. \n",

It does not have to be integer and unless $g(r_1)=g(r_2)=0$ it is an ill defined quantity. Nevertheless, it is a commonly quoted number in research papers so it is important to read carefully how it has been caclulated to obtain meaningful conclusions that can be compared to figures in other research work. \n",

        "In order to measure $g(r)$ directly, we need to obtain a 3D (unless we are looking at a 2D system) image of the material in which all the particle coordinates $r_i(x,y,z)$ can be obtained. Although some modern techniques can obtain images with atomic resolution (for example scanning tunneling microscopy) they are mostly limited to surface imaging and not suitable for studying liquids (where atoms are moving around). Although some X-ray and electron microscopy techniques (see for example ptychography) can produce atomic scale resolution (using coherent imgaing techniques) these are again largely confined to 2D surfaces and are again not suitable for atomic liquids.\n",
        "\n",
        "Historically (1950-60s) the first attempts to determine $g(r)$ came from measurement of the packing of real particles made by literally constructing disordered structures with balls and sticks, gelatine balls, plasticine etc. and then painstakingly finding the particle coordinates  careful ans systematic  disassembly. Needless to say this wasn't a particularly accurate method but it did reveal, what suprised many at the time, dense packing of particles in liquids was characterised by 5-fold coordination. \n",
        "\n",
        "Today there is much literature on the study of  disorder and phase changes in colloidal systems (particles of the order of 100s of nanometres in size and greater) and we will take a look at some of the methods used to do these experiments. The spirit of these experimentments is the same - we try to measure the positions of the particles in space and ideally also over time (to see how they move).\n",

        "## The structure of colloidal systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Colloids are complex systems composed of mesoscopic particles suspended in a host liquid. They and emulsions (liquid drops in a host liquid) are found everywhere around us. They are used extensively in food processing and paints etc. Much work has been done to stabilize and control their properties but here we will look briefly at how they have been used to study phase transitions, glasses and particle coordination in 'simple' systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "In its simplest form a colloid consists of small (mesoscopic) particles suspended in a solvent. However, if you simply mix and stir say small spherical particles in a solvent you will often observe $\\it{flocculation}$. Fundamentally, there is an attractive force, called the depletion force, that is driven by the excluded volumes (and associated entropy) around hard spheres as they come into contact. That is. the particles tend to clump together into larger aggregates. So, in order to produce a homogeneous phase of uniform particle density, the colloid needs to be $\\it{stabilised}$. The stabilization of colloids and emulsions is a vast subject, but in short, by adding additional chemicals (e.g. surfactants) to the solvent it is possible to introduce some repulsion between the particles that overcomes the tendency to flocculate. The type and concentration of the added chemicals causes a change in the electrostatic attraction/repulsion between the particles and gives rise to the zeta ($\\zeta$) potential. To mimic ideal 'hard sphere' behaviour the aim is to have a colloid with a zeta potential of zero. i.e. there is no net attraction or repulsion (except the hard sphere itself) between the particles. \n",
        "\n",
        "There are other ways to stabilize colloids for example, steric repulsion. In this method long chain molelcules are incorporated into the particles to make them \\`hairy'. The presence of these hairs reduces the excluded volume around the particles and hence reduces the depletion force between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "From here on we will assume that we are able to create such an ideal hard sphere colloid! For a comphrensive and detailed review of studies of colloidal hard sphere systems see the review of Royall et. al. 2024\n",

        "\n",
        "If we have our ideal colloid there are several things we may wish to control. For example, what is the size of the particles (there will be a tendency for large particles to sediment), are the particles all the same size (polydispersivity), can we make systems with different shapes (e.g. ovoid), can we make systems with mixed particle sizes, can we introduce directional interactions (Janus particles) and how do you control the number density of the particles (the density of the particles is the crucial parameter for describing the hard sphere phase diagram)? These all pose theoretical and experimental difficulties of their own. Finally, once we've prepared our colloid with a controlled density ... how do we study its structure (and dynamics)?\n",

        "## Confocal microscopy.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a few further steps we need to achieve to be able to measure and track the positions of the particles in our hard sphere colloid. Firstly, it is important that the particles are transparent, otherwise, we will not be able to see into the depth of the sample and secondly we need to match, as closely as possible, the refractive index of the solvent. If we don't do this the difference in refractive index will mean light is quickly scattered in all directions meaning we will just have an opaque material. Howver, by making that the particles all but invisible how to we determine their positions? The trick is to include a fluorescent die in the centre their centre. When illuminated with the correct wavelength of light (using a laser) the particles will glow. This works well but how to we measure the positions of the particles in 3D. The answer is to use a confocal microscope as illustrated below (figure take from Royall et. al.2024). \n",

        "\n",
        "In the confocal microscope laser light is passed through a small pinhole and then brought to focus at a point in the sample by a lens, known as the condenser lens. The fluorescent light coming back from the illuminated samples is then focused by the objective lens (which in this case is the same lens as the condenser) and the microscopy image is obtained by the camera. However, although the laser light is brought to a tight focus in the sample there are nevertheless still regions that are illuminated by the laser that, under normal circumstances, would also bring unwanted light into the camera. The key point of the confocal system is that a second pinhole is placed precisely at the focus (hence confocal) of the objective lens for the light coming from the sample. The effect of this pinhole is to reduce the volume of the sample that is illuminated and seen by the camera. The method is good enough that the fluorescence from individual particles can be observed clearly and the ability to resolve the individual particles is given by the diffraction limit imposed by the wavelength of the laser light used. (There are also ways in which this has been overcome to an extent in practical systems).   The figures below, also taken from Royall et. al. 2024 shows examples of confocal images used to map out the phase diagram of the hard sphere system.\n",

        "As mentioned previously, the early attempts at understanding the packing of particles in disordered materials came to te conclusion that 5 fold coordination (inconsistent with the long range order required for crystals) was the characteristic of simple dense packed structures. In the same spirit as these early experiments the results from confocal imaging have allowed the prevalence of different types of local ordering to investigated. This leads to the mapping out the topological cluster distribution (i.e. the different types of lcoal structure) that occur in the systems. As noted before, these higher order correlations may be calculated from the particle positions (once we have them) but cannot be determined unambiguously from measurements of $g(r)$ alone. \n",

        "\n",
        "Although simulation is not strictly an experimental method, it is neither a truly theoretical method either. This said, from the experimentalist point of view, especially in the case of the colloind systems studied above, they provide a direct comparison in real space with the data. As such the experiemntal results are an important check of the veracity of the simulation methods especially with regard to application of for example theoretical potentials. The simulation methods naturally exploit the interaction of the particles in real space (we know the positions of the particles and we calculate how they move under the influence of the interparticle forces. Hence, its is quite straight forward to compare the real space configurations measured in experiment with the particle coordinates in the simulation. The comparison between the experiment and simulation and the level of agreement that can be achieved is strikingly seen in the $g(r)$ comparison for hard spheres shown above. Simulations however are not the answer to everything. They get more and more computer intensive as larger numbers of particles are included and the time scales over which they are carried out are extremely short compared to those in experiments. The latter is a particular issue with studies of the glass transition (as always) where the physical processes contributing to the glass transition may occur of a very wide range of timescales.\n",
        "\n",
        "The comparison of simulation results with experimental diffraction data is more difficult. Diffraction experiments are a reciprocal space measurement and to compare to simulation we need to work out the corresponding real space ($g(r)$ ) distributions. Hence when comparing experiment with simulation we have to choose whether to transform our reciprocal space data to real space (with associated problems) or convert the real space data from our simulations to reciprocal space for comparison (that also has problems). This is the subject of the next part of this course.\n",

Needless to say the process involves taking confocal images of the particles over time scales in which they will move only slightly from their initial position. With sophisticated software it is then possible to label the particles and track their position and hence coordinates in succesive image frames. This work well if you are in the sweet spot for the measurements but is a challenge, for example in glass transition experiments, where the experimental timescales become longer and longer as you approach the conditions for the glass transition to take place. This is still a very active field.\n",
