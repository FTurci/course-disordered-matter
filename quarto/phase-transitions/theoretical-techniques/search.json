    "text": "Lecturer: Prof. Nigel Wilding (nigel.wilding@bristol.ac.uk)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplex disordered matter is a central theme in soft matter physics, encompassing systems such as polymers, colloids, glasses, gels, and emulsions that lack long-range order but display intricate and often tunable behavior. Colloids—suspensions of microscopic particles in a fluid—serve as versatile model systems for studying disordered structures and phase behavior because their particle-scale dynamics are directly observable. Similarly, polymer systems and colloidal suspensions can form amorphous solids, or glasses, when densely packed or cooled, exhibiting solid-like rigidity despite their disordered, liquid-like microscopic structure. These materials frequently undergo equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions such as demixing, crystallisation, gelation, vitrification, or jamming, and near these transitions, they may show critical phenomena where fluctuations and correlations span many length scales.\nIn soft matter systems, the interplay between disorder, softness, and phase behavior leads to rich physical phenomena, particularly near critical points where even small changes in external conditions can trigger large-scale reorganizations and universal behaviour. Glasses, for instance, exhibit slow relaxation and memory effects, while colloidal systems may crystallize, phase separate, or become jammed depending on particle interactions and concentration. Understanding such behaviors involves studying how microscopic interactions and thermal fluctuations influence macroscopic properties, especially in non-equilibrium conditions. Through techniques like scattering, microscopy, rheology, and simulation, one can explore how disordered soft materials respond to stress, age, or undergo transitions—insights that are vital for applications in materials design, biotechnology, and beyond.\nThis course is organized into three interconnected parts, each offering a distinct perspective on the study of complex disordered matter.\n\nPart 1: Unifying theoretical concepts (Nigel Wilding) introduces the theoretical framework for rationalising complex disordered matter which is grounded in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. We emphasize the theory of phase transitions, critical phenomena, and stochastic dynamics—providing the essential tools needed to describe and predict the behavior of soft and disordered systems.\n\nPart 2: Complex disordered matter (Francesco Turci) explores the phenomenology of key examples of complex disordered soft matter systems, including colloids, polymers, liquid crystals, glasses, gels, and active matter. These systems will be analyzed using the theoretical concepts introduced in Part 1, highlighting how disorder, interactions, and fluctuations shape their macroscopic behavior.\n\nPart 3: Experimental techniques (Adrian Barnes) focuses on the methods of microscopy, and scattering via x-rays, neutrons and light that are used to study these complex disordered matter, offering insight into how their properties are measured and understood in real-world contexts.\n\nIn addition to theory and experiment, computer simulation plays a central role in soft matter research. This course includes a substantial coursework component consisting of two computational projects. These exercises will allow you to apply state-of-the-art simulation techniques to investigate the complex behavior of disordered systems, bridging theory and observation through hands-on exploration.\n\n\nDelivery and format\n\nDetailed e-notes (see Blackboard) can be viewed on a variety of devices. Pdf is also available.\nWe will give ‘traditional’ lectures (XXday, YYYday) in which we use slides to summarise and explain the lecture content. Questions are welcome (within reason…)\nTry to read ahead in the notes, then come to lectures, listen to the explanations and then reread the notes.\nRewriting the notes or slides to express your own thoughts and understanding, or annotating a pdf copy can help wire the material into your own way of thinking.\nThere are problem classes (XXXday) where you can try problem sheets and seek help. I will go over some problems with the class.\nThe navigation bar on the left will allow you to access the lecture notes and problem sets.\n\n\n\nQuestions and comments\nIf you have any questions about the course, please don’t hesitate to contact me, either by email (see above) or in a problems class.\nFinally, this is a new course for 2025/26, with the lecture notes written from scratch. If you find any errors or mistakes or something which isn’t clear, please let me know, or fill in this anonymous form:",

    "title": "Dynamics of first order phase transitions: nucleation and growth",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In previous discussions, we considered first-order phase transitions but deferred a detailed analysis of the dynamical mechanism by which a system evolves from one phase to another. We now address this question explicitly.\nConsider again the Ising model at a temperature \\(T &lt; T_c\\), where the system is initially prepared in the majority spin-up phase at zero external field, \\(H = 0\\). We now examine the system’s response to the application of a small negative external field $ H &lt; 0 $, which lowers the free energy of the spin-down phase relative to the spin-up phase.\nDespite the global free energy favoring the spin-down phase, the system does not undergo an instantaneous transition. This delay is a consequence of the free energy barrier associated with nucleating a region of the stable phase within the metastable one, as introduced in Chapter 5. The dynamical pathway of the phase transition proceeds via nucleation of localized regions—referred to as droplets—of the stable (spin-down) phase embedded within the metastable (spin-up) background. Once nucleated, these droplets may grow over time and ultimately coalesce to transform the system to the stable phase.\nThe nucleation of a droplet of the stable phase of size \\(n\\) spins entails a competition between bulk and interfacial contributions to the free energy. The bulk free energy gain is linear in \\(n\\), given by \\(-nH\\), due to the alignment of spins with the external field. However, this gain is offset by an interfacial free energy cost arising from broken bonds at the boundary between phases. For the Ising model, each broken bond contributes an energy cost of \\(+2J\\), so the total interfacial energy scales with the perimeter (in 2D) or surface area (in 3D) of the droplet. This interfacial contribution is referred to as the surface tension, and constitutes a true free energy cost: it includes not only the energetic penalty from broken bonds but also an entropic contribution due to the configurational degrees of freedom associated with the droplet shape.\nThe resulting competition between the extensive free energy gain and the sub-extensive interfacial cost leads to a free energy barrier for droplet formation. Only fluctuations that produce a droplet larger than a critical size \\(n_c\\) will grow; smaller droplets will shrink. This framework is formalized in classical nucleation theory, which provides a quantitative description of the nucleation rate, critical droplet size, and the associated activation energy barrier.\n\n\n\nWe now present the framework of classical nucleation theory (CNT) for the case of homogeneous nucleation, in which the nucleation of the stable phase occurs spontaneously and uniformly throughout the bulk of the metastable phase, without the aid of impurities, defects, or surfaces.\nLet us consider a droplet of the stable (spin-down) phase of radius \\(R\\) embedded within the metastable (spin-up) background. The total change in free energy \\(\\Delta F(R)\\) associated with forming such a droplet consists of two competing contributions:\n\nBulk free energy gain: The interior of the droplet consists of \\(V \\sim R^d\\) spins aligned with the external field \\(H &lt; 0\\), leading to a volume free energy change\n\\[\n\\Delta F_{\\text{bulk}}(R) = -|\\Delta f| \\, R^d,\n\\]\nwhere \\(|\\Delta f| \\propto |H|\\) is the free energy density difference between the metastable and stable phases, and \\(d\\) is the spatial dimensionality of the system.\nInterfacial free energy cost: The boundary between the two phases has a surface area scaling as \\(R^{d-1}\\), and incurs a free energy cost proportional to the surface tension \\(\\sigma\\):\n\\[\n\\Delta F_{\\text{surface}}(R) = \\sigma \\, S_d \\, R^{d-1},\n\\]\nwhere \\(S_d\\) is a geometrical factor (e.g., \\(S_2 = 2\\pi\\) in 2D and \\(S_3 = 4\\pi\\) in 3D).\n\nThe total free energy change is therefore given by\n\\[\n\\Delta F(R) = \\sigma \\, S_d \\, R^{d-1} - |\\Delta f| \\, V_d \\, R^d,\n\\]\nwhere \\(V_d\\) is another dimension-dependent constant. This expression exhibits a characteristic maximum at a critical droplet radius \\(R_c\\), obtained by extremizing \\(\\Delta F(R)\\) with respect to \\(R\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\Delta F}{dR} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad R_c = \\frac{(d-1)\\sigma S_d}{d |\\Delta f| V_d}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Free energy barrier \\(\\Delta F(r)\\) for nucleation of a spherical droplet as a function of radius \\(R\\) (schematic)\n\n\n\nThe corresponding free energy barrier for nucleation is\n\\[\n\\Delta F_c = \\Delta F(R_c) = \\frac{(d-1)^{d-1}}{d^d} \\cdot \\frac{(S_d)^d \\, \\sigma^d}{(|\\Delta f|)^{d-1} \\, (V_d)^{d-1}}.\n\\]\nThis barrier must be surmounted by thermal fluctuations in order for a critical nucleus to form and grow. The nucleation rate per unit volume is given (in the Arrhenius approximation) by\n\\[\nI \\sim I_0 \\exp\\left( -\\frac{\\Delta F_c}{k_B T} \\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(I_0\\) is a prefactor determined by microscopic kinetics, and \\(k_B\\) is Boltzmann’s constant.\n\n\nSeveral key features emerge from this analysis:\n\nBarrier scaling: The nucleation barrier \\(\\Delta F_c \\sim \\sigma^d / |\\Delta f|^{d-1}\\) diverges as \\(H \\to 0\\), reflecting the increasing stability of the metastable phase near the coexistence point.\nCritical radius: The critical droplet size \\(R_c \\sim \\sigma / |\\Delta f|\\) also diverges as \\(|\\Delta f| \\to 0\\), indicating that larger fluctuations are required to initiate nucleation close to the coexistence line.\nDimensional dependence: Both \\(\\Delta F_c\\) and \\(R_c\\) exhibit strong dependence on the spatial dimension \\(d\\), with nucleation becoming increasingly suppressed in higher dimensions due to the dominance of interfacial cost.\n\nIn summary, homogeneous nucleation in a first-order transition is governed by a delicate balance between surface tension and bulk free energy gain. Only droplets exceeding a critical size can overcome the barrier and initiate a transition. This sets an intrinsic timescale for the dynamics of phase transformation, which can become extremely long near coexistence due to the exponentially small nucleation rate.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing successful nucleation of a supercritical droplet, the system enters a regime where the global transformation is driven by the deterministic growth of domains of the stable phase. This phase of the dynamics is often referred to as coarsening or phase ordering dynamics.\nAt late times, the dynamics are controlled not by rare fluctuations, but by the energetically-driven evolution of domain structures. The nature of domain growth depends sensitively on whether the order parameter is conserved or not.\n\n\n\nIn systems with a non-conserved order parameter, such as the Ising model with single spin flip (so called Glauber) dynamics, the order parameter can relax locally without constraint. This leads to curvature-driven motion of interfaces.\nThe typical domain size \\(L(t)\\) grows algebraically with time:\n\\[\nL(t) \\sim t^{1/2},\n\\]\ncorresponding to a dynamic exponent \\(z = 2\\). The growth is driven by reduction of the total interfacial area—regions of high curvature (small domains) shrink and are absorbed by larger, flatter ones.\nLet is aassume that domain walls move with velocity proportional to curvature: \\[\n  v \\sim \\frac{1}{L}\n  \\] Then with the typical domain size being \\(L(t)\\) it follows that\n\\[\n  \\frac{dL}{dt} \\sim \\frac{1}{L}\n  \\]\nIntegrating both sides yields the \\(t^{1/2}\\) domain growth law.\nIt turns out that the detailed evolution of the coarse-grained order parameter field \\(\\phi(\\mathbf{r}, t)\\) is governed by the Allen–Cahn equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\delta F[\\phi]}{\\delta \\phi},\n\\]\nwhere \\(F[\\phi]\\) is a coarse-grained Ginzburg–Landau free energy functional:\n\\[\nF[\\phi] = \\int d^d x \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + V(\\phi) \\right],\n\\]\nwith \\(V(\\phi)\\) typically a double-well potential such as \\(V(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{4}(\\phi^2 - 1)^2\\).\n\n\n\n\nFor systems with a conserved order parameter, such as phase separation in binary alloys or the Ising model with spin-swap (so called ‘Kawasaki’) dynamics, the order parameter (e.g., composition or particle number) must be conserved locally. This imposes a diffusive constraint on the dynamics.\nThe domain size again grows algebraically, but with a different exponent:\n\\[\nL(t) \\sim t^{1/3},\n\\]\ncorresponding to a dynamic exponent \\(z = 3\\).\nA chemical potential difference drives diffusion and is given by \\[\n\\Delta \\mu \\sim \\frac{\\sigma}{L}\n\\] (again due to curvature, where \\(\\sigma\\) is surface tension)\nNow the flux is proportional to the chemical potential gradient (Fick’s law): \\[\n\\text{Flux} \\sim -\\nabla \\mu \\sim \\frac{\\Delta \\mu}{L} \\sim \\frac{\\sigma}{L^2}\n\\]\nand the rate of change of domain size is proportional to this flux: \\[\n\\frac{dL}{dt} \\sim \\frac{1}{L^2}\n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad\nL(t) \\sim t^{1/3}\n\\]\nIt turns out that the detailed dynamics are described by the Cahn–Hilliard equation, a continuity equation of the form:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = \\nabla^2 \\left( \\frac{\\delta F[\\phi]}{\\delta \\phi} \\right),\n\\]\nreflecting that the order parameter can only evolve via diffusion of its conjugate chemical potential. This leads to the slow transport of material across domains and a more sluggish coarsening process compared to the non-conserved case.\n\n\n\nHere are schematic illustrations of domain growth for:\n\nNon-conserved dynamics (Model A): Domains coarsen rapidly, with smoother and larger regions due to free relaxation of the order parameter.\nConserved dynamics (Model B): Coarsening is slower and domains are more intricate, reflecting the constraint of local conservation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Conserved Dynamics (Model A)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConserved Dynamics (Model B)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Schematic illustrations of domain morphology resulting from non-conserved and conserved dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt late times, both conserved and non-conserved systems exhibit dynamic scaling: the statistical properties of the domain morphology become self-similar under rescaling of lengths by \\(L(t)\\).\nFor example, the equal-time two-point correlation function satisfies\n\\[\nC(r, t) = f\\left( \\frac{r}{L(t)} \\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(f(x)\\) is a time-independent scaling function. Plots of \\(C(r,t)\\) collapse when plotted as a function of \\(r/L(t)\\).The structure factor \\(S(k, t)\\) also obeys dynamic scaling:\n\\[\nS(k, t) = L(t)^d \\, g(k L(t)),\n\\]\nwith \\(g(x)\\) a universal scaling function dependent on the dynamical class and dimensionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamics Type\nConservation\nEquation Type\nGrowth Law\nDynamic Exponent\n\n\n\n\nModel A (e.g. Glauber)\nNo\nAllen–Cahn\n\\(L(t) \\sim t^{1/2}\\)\n\\(z = 2\\)\n\n\nModel B (e.g. Kawasaki)\nYes\nCahn–Hilliard\n\\(L(t) \\sim t^{1/3}\\)\n\\(z = 3\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nRemarks: The domain growth exponents \\(1/z\\) are robust under many conditions, but can be modified in the presence of disorder, long-range interactions, or hydrodynamic effects.\n\n\nIn both the model A and model B cases, the system coarsens until it reaches equilibrium, characterized by a uniform macroscopic phase and the complete elimination of interfaces.\n\n\nThe approach to equilibrium is algebraically slow (described by power laws) due to the scale-free nature of domain dynamics.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "It is a matter of experimental fact that the approach to criticality in a given system is characterized by the divergence of various thermodynamic observables. Let us remain with the archetypal example of a critical system, the ferromagnet, whose critical temperature will be denoted as \\(T_c\\). For temperatures close to \\(T_c\\), the magnetic response functions (the magnetic susceptibility \\(\\chi\\) and the specific heat) are found to be singular functions, diverging as a power of the reduced (dimensionless) temperature \\(t \\equiv\n(T-T_c)/T_c\\):-\n\\[\\chi \\equiv \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial H}\\propto t^{-\\gamma} ~~~~ (H=0)\n\\label{eq:chipow}\\]\n(where \\(M=mN\\)), \\[C_H \\equiv \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial T}\\propto t^{-\\alpha} ~~~~ (H=\\textrm{ constant})\n\\label{eq:Cv}\\]\nAnother key quantity is the correlation length \\(\\xi\\), which measures the distance over which fluctuations of the magnetic moments are correlated. This is observed to diverge near the critical point with an exponent \\(\\nu\\).\n\\[\\xi \\propto t^{-\\nu} ~~~~ (T &gt; T_c,\\: H=0)\n\\label{eq:corr}\\]\nSimilar power law behaviour is found for the order parameter \\(Q\\) (in this case the magnetisation) which vanishes in a singular fashion (it has infinite gradient) as the critical point is is approached as a function of temperature:\n\\[m \\propto t^{\\beta} ~~~~ (T &lt; T_c,\\: H=0) \\label{eq:mag},\\] (here the symbol \\(\\beta\\), is not to be confused with \\(\\beta=1/k_BT\\)– this unfortunately is the standard notation.)\nFinally, as a function of magnetic field:\n\\[m \\propto h^{1/\\delta} ~~~~ (T = T_c,\\: H&gt;0) \\label{eq:field}.\\] with \\(h=(H-H_c)/H_c\\), the reduced magnetic field.\nAs examples, the behaviour of the magnetisation and correlation length are plotted in fig. 4 as a function of \\(t\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Singular behaviour of the correlation length and order parameter in the vicinity of the critical point as a function of the reduced temperature \\(t\\).\n\n\n\nThe quantities \\(\\gamma, \\alpha, \\nu, \\beta\\) in the above equations are known as critical exponents. They serve to control the rate at which the various thermodynamic quantities change on the approach to criticality.\nRemarkably, the form of singular behaviour observed at criticality for the example ferromagnet also occurs in qualitatively quite different systems such as the fluid. All that is required to obtain the corresponding power law relationships for the fluid is to substitute the analogous thermodynamic quantities in to the above equations. Accordingly the magnetisation order parameter is replaced by the density difference \\(\\rho_{liq}-\\rho_{gas}\\) while the susceptibility is replaced by the isothermal compressibility and the specific heat capacity at constant field is replaced by the specific heat capacity at constant volume. The approach to criticality in a variety of qualitatively quite different systems can therefore be expressed in terms of a set of critical exponents describing the power law behaviour for that system (see the book by Yeomans for examples).\nEven more remarkable is the experimental observation that the values of the critical exponents for a whole range of fluids and magnets (and indeed many other systems with critical points) are identical. This is the phenomenon of universality. It implies a deep underlying physical similarity between ostensibly disparate critical systems. The principal aim of theories of critical point phenomena is to provide a sound theoretical basis for the existence of power law behaviour, the factors governing the observed values of critical exponents and the universality phenomenon. Ultimately this basis is provided by the Renormalisation Group (RG) theory, for which K.G. Wilson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1982.",

    "text": "Background concepts\nIn seeking to describe near-critical phenomena, it is useful to have a quantitative measure of the difference between the phases coalescing at the critical point: this is the role of the order parameter, \\(Q\\). In the case of the fluid, the order parameter is taken as the difference between the densities of the liquid and vapour phases. In the ferromagnet it is taken as the magnetisation. As its name suggest, the order parameter serves as a measure of the kind of orderliness that sets in when the temperature is cooled below a critical temperature.\nOur first task is to give some feeling for the principles which underlie the ordering process. The probability \\(p_a\\) that a physical system at temperature \\(T\\) will have a particular microscopic arrangement (configuration), labelled \\(a\\), of energy \\(E_a\\) is\n\\[p_a=\\frac{1}{Z}e^{-E_a/k_BT}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThe prefactor \\(Z^{-1}\\) is the partition function: since the system must always have some specific arrangement, the sum of the probabilities \\(p_a\\) must be unity, implying that\n\\[Z=\\sum_ae^{-E_a/k_BT}\n\\tag{2}\\] where the sum extends over all possible microscopic arrangements.\nThese equations assume that physical system evolves rapidly (on the timescale of typical observations) amongst all its allowed arrangements, sampling them with the probabilities Equation 1 the expectation value of any physical observable \\(O\\) will thus be given by averaging \\(O\\) over all the arrangements \\(a\\), weighting each contribution by the appropriate probability:\n\\[\\bar {O}=\\frac{1}{Z}\\sum_a O_a e^{-E_a/k_BT}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nSums like Equation 3 are not easily evaluated. Nevertheless, some important insights follow painlessly. Consider the case where the observable of interest is the order parameter, or more specifically the magnetisation of a ferromagnet.\n\\[Q=\\frac{1}{Z}\\sum_a Q_a e^{-E_a/k_BT}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nIt is clear from Equation 1 that at very low temperature the system will be overwhelmingly likely to be found in its minimum energy arrangements (ground states). For the ferromagnet, these are the fully ordered spin arrangements having magnetisation \\(+1\\), or \\(-1\\).\nNow consider the high temperature limit. The enhanced weight that the fully ordered arrangement carries in the sum of Equation 4 by virtue of its low energy, is now no longer sufficient to offset the fact that arrangements in which \\(Q_a\\) has some intermediate value, though each carry a smaller weight, are vastly greater in number. A little thought shows that the arrangements which have essentially zero magnetisation (equal populations of up and down spins) are by far the most numerous. At high temperature, these disordered arrangements dominate the sum in Equation 4 and the order parameter is zero.\nThe competition between energy-of-arrangements weighting (or simply ‘energy’) and the ‘number of arrangements’ weighting (or ‘entropy’) is then the key principle at work here. The distinctive feature of a system with a critical point is that, in the course of this competition, the system is forced to choose amongst a number of macroscopically different sets of microscopic arrangements.\nFinally in this section, we note that the probabilistic (statistical mechanics) approach to thermal systems outlined above is completely compatible with classical thermodynamics. Specifically, the bridge between the two disciplines is provided by the following equation\n\\[F=-k_BT \\ln Z\n\\tag{5}\\]\nwhere \\(F\\) is the “Helmholtz free energy”. All thermodynamic observables, for example the order parameter \\(Q\\), and response functions such as the specific heat or magnetic susceptibility are obtainable as appropriate derivatives of the free energy. For instance, utilizing Equation 2, one can readily verify (try it as an exercise!) that the average internal energy is given by\n\\[\\bar{E}=-\\frac{\\partial \\ln Z}{\\partial \\beta},\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta=(k_BT)^{-1}\\).\nThe relationship between other thermodynamic quantities and derivatives of the free energy are given in fig. 3\n\n\n\nRelationships between the partition function and thermodynamic observables",
