Most of the matter around us does not simply fit within the idealised pictures of crystallines solids or simple liquids: examples include colloids, polymers, surfactants, liquid crystals, foams, gels, and biological materials such as proteins, DNA, and cell membranes.

This means that cellular **life itself** (the very constituents that make us) obeys to principles that go beyond the standard patters of conventional solid-state physics.

This branch of physics is called **soft condensed matter physics**, or **macromolecular** physics, or the physics of **complex fluids**. Specifically, *sof matter* refers to an area of condensed matter focused on systems that can be *easily deformed*.

While we often think about problems in physics as a matter of energy minimisation, in soft-matter physics a key role is played by the **fluctuations**. Typically (but not exclusively) these are **thermal fluctuations**. This means that **entropy** and not only the energy from the interactions plays a key role.

This is because soft matter systems are typically composed of **many microscopic constituents** in contact with an **environment**. The appropriate description of the **macroscopic state** of such systems is therefore **statistical** and uses the language of **statistical mechanics**. The relevant **energy**, therefore, is the free energy of the statistical ensemble representative of the system under consideration. For example, in the canonical ensemble, this is the Helmholtz free energy

$$F = U-TS$$

where $U$ is the internal energy, $T$ the temperature and $S$ is the entropy of the system. Therefore, in a broader sense, soft matter is the physics of those systems for which the internal energy and the entropy are on comparable scales.

In other words, **fluctuations of the internal energy** are on the same scale as **thermal fluctuations**:

$$\Delta U \sim k_BT $$

where $k_B$ is the Bolztmann constant and $\Delta U$ indicates standard deviations from the average internal energy.

# The Physics of Entropy

Soft matter physics is fundamentally the physics of **entropy**. Unlike traditional systems where interaction energy minimization dominates, in soft matter, entropy plays a crucial role in determining the structure, dynamics, and behaviour of the system. The interplay between entropy and intermolecular energy leads to the rich and diverse phenomena observed in soft matter systems.

## Systems and definitions

### Elementary constituents and energy scales

Soft matter covers a wide spectrum of deformable systems. Each is constituted of many parts . Each is deformable because the interactions amongst such parts are **weak** compared to the perturbing forces (e.g. thermal fluctuations or mechanical loading).

In hard condensed matter, the elementary constituents are the atoms themselves, eventually with their subatomic particles. Between atoms, the scale of the interaction energies is in the 0.1 to 10 eV: for example the carbon-carbon covalent bond is approximately 3.6  eV. 

The main units of soft matter are not atoms. They are instead themselves aggregates of atoms such as:

- **colloids**, micrometer- to nanometer-sized particles dispersed in a fluid.
- **polymers**, macromolecules composed of long chains such as DNA, proteins, plastics
- **surfactants**, macromolecules wuth polar head and tails that lead to the spontaneous formation of structures such as bilayers (e.g. the cellular membrane).  

Amongst such units, the dominating forces of soft matter are much weaker than in hard condensed matter:

- Van der Waals forces are of the order of 0.001-0.01 eV 
- weak interactions such as hydrogen-bonds are typically in the 0.01-0.2 eV range
- the thermal energy at room temperature is $k_B T \approx 0.025 eV$ (check it for yourself)

At the **microscopic** level, all these interactions have essentialy one source: the electrostatic force. However, this information is practically of no use when we want to understand how the units of soft matter come together to give rise to **macroscopic** properties of soft matter systems, such as their elastic properties, their viscosities, their plasticity. In fact, the emphasis on the atomistic details of the various units is fundamentally misleading: atomistically very different objects (e.g. colloids and micelles) can in fact share very similar macroscopic behaviours.

Therefore, theories of soft matter leverage the concept of **coarse-graining**, rooted in the renormalisation group notions explored earlier. Coarse-graining means integrating out the unimportant degrees of freedom and only describing the units in terms of a few important parameters. For example, instead of taking a full atomistic representation of the DNA we may want to focus on the fact that structurally it is a long chain with specific bending energies: we may want to include the fact that it is formed by a double helix but we may not want to specifically construct every single atom in the sugar chain the forms the backbone. An example of DNA coarse garining is provided by the succesful model [oxDNA](https://dna.physics.ox.ac.uk/index.php/Main_Page) (see picture below):

# Coarse graining
Coarse graining is often motivated by intuition, experimental insights or a simple desire of simplification. It allows for a multi-scale description of the problem which permits to describe large systems and log time scales.

Nonetheless, coarse-graining can also be made mathematically rigorous. For example, rigorous coarse graining in statistical mechanics can be performed by projecting the dynamics onto a relevant and an irrelevant (fluctutating) part, in the so called [**Mori-Zwanzig** formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mori-Zwanzig_formalism) [@mori1965].

### Classes of systems

In our exploration of soft matter we will focus on five main classes of systems which display different physics:

- colloidal dispersions
- polymeric systems
- liquid crystals
- surfactant aggregates
- arrested systems

#### Colloidal dispersions {.unnumbered}
Colloidal dispersions are systems where small particles, typically in the nanometer to micrometer range, are dispersed in a continuous medium (a solvent). Prototypical colloids are **spherical** particles of various sizes (e.g. as those present in paint) but colloidal science has achieved a high degree of sophistication, with colloidal particles with various different shapes and interactions.

Colloids are often thought as **big atoms**: they exhibit Brownian motion, can form ordered structures (colloidal crystals), and display phase transitions similar to atomic systems. However, their larger size and slower dynamics make them ideal for studying phenomena that are difficult to observe in atomic systems.

#### Liquid crystals {.unnumbered}

#### Surfactant aggregates {.unnumbered}


#### Arrested systems {.unnumbered}
