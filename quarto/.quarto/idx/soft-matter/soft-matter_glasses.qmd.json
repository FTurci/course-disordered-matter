Toluene and methanol also readily form glasses.\n\n### Relaxation time and viscosity\n\nLet us first consider relaxation in liquids. We have already seen that at high volume fractions a particle is effectively trapped by its nearest neighbours, within a 'cage'. To escape the cage, a particle must jump. Let us now consider the characteristic time $\\tau$ between such jumps and its dependence on temperature. Empirically, one finds that\n\n$$\n\\tau^{-1} \\sim v \\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{k_{B} T}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere $v$ is the typical vibration frequency for a particle rattling around in its cage. This can also be regarded as the frequency with which the particle attempts to escape its cage. The probability of an escape attempt succeeding depends on a Boltzmann factor, i.e. the exponential of the ratio of the energy cost associated with climbing the cage \"walls\", $\\varepsilon$, to the typical thermal energy $k_{B} T$.\n\nIt can be shown (cf. PH10002), that the relaxation time $\\tau$ is proportional to another quantity, the viscosity $\\eta$, which is a measure of the response of a material to a shear stress, or more loosely speaking a measure of the ability of a liquid to flow. Thus $\\tau \\propto \\eta$ and it follows that\n\n$$\n\\eta=\\frac{G_{0}}{v} \\exp \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{k_{B} T}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $G_{0}$ is a proportionality constant. This characteristic exponential temperature dependence is known as Arrhenius behaviour. Loosely speaking the viscosity provides a measure of the ability of a liquid to flow.\n\nWhile Arrhenius behaviour is observed for the viscosity of liquids at high temperature, things are very different at low temperature. The experimentally measured viscosity and the associated configurational relaxation time exhibits a temperature dependence that strongly departs from that implied by the characteristic frequency of vibrations $v$\n\n$$\n\\eta=\\eta_{0} \\exp \\left(\\frac{B}{T-T_{0}}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe empirical finding, known as the Vogel-Fulcher law implies that the viscosity diverges exponentially at the finite temperature $T_{0}$. In practical terms, this means that as $T_{0}$ is approached from above, one reaches some temperature $T_{g}$ (the glass transition temperature) at which the time for a configuration to relax becomes\ncomparable to the timescale of the experiment itself $\\tau_{\\exp }$. At this point, the system falls out of equilibrium with respect to rearrangements of the particle configurations.\n\n### Characterising the glass transition\n\nThe glass transition temperature $T_{g}$ is that temperature at which the system falls out of equilibrium on the experimental timescale $\\tau_{\\text {exp. }}$. Clearly therefore, if one does a long experiment, in which the temperature is lowered slowly, the system will have a greater time to relax at each successive temperature and will stay in equilibrium to a lower temperature. Thus the experimental glass transition temperature depends on the rate at which we do the experiment. To illustrate this consider a measurement of some structural quantity (such as the sample volume) as a function of temperature. Various scenarios for the behaviour of the volume as the temperature are shown in the following figure\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-37.jpg?height=875&width=1231&top_left_y=1113&top_left_x=344)\n\nAt the glass transition temperature, the curve exhibits a well defined discontinuity in it slope, rather like what happens at an equilibrium phase transition such as freezing or boiling. The reason why the glass transition is not a true thermodynamic phase transition is that the temperature at which the discontinuity occurs depends on the history of the sample, i.e. how rapidly it is cooled. We say that the glass transition is a kinetic phase transition brought on by the divergence of the structural relaxation time.\n\n### A simple picture of the glass transition\n\nTheories of the glass transition are a matter of intense current research and it is probably fair to say that the detailed physics is still not well understood in a comprehensive fashion. Nevertheless simple models offer some insight, in qualitative if not quantitative agreement with experiment. One such theory is based on the idea of cooperativity. In a liquid at high temperatures, a molecule can diffuse simply by moving to occupy the space made available by the random local motions of its neighbours. At low temperatures and high volume fractions, the local motion of neighbours is insufficent to allow diffusion. Instead a number of neighbours must move cooperatively in order to make space for a molecule to move. The minimum number of molecules that have to move in unison in order for diffusion of a molecule to take place gives rise to the concept of a cooperative rearranging region. As the temperature is lowered the size of this region increases, diverging (with the viscosity) at the Vogel-Fulcher temperature $T_{0}$\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-38.jpg?height=597&width=621&top_left_y=1152&top_left_x=295)\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-38.jpg?height=577&width=604&top_left_y=1162&top_left_x=1086)\n\nIf we suppose that the energy barrier for a single molecule to move is $\\mu$ and there are $z$ molecules in the cooperatively rearranging region, then the thermal activation barrier for motion is\n\n$$\n\\tau^{-1} \\sim v \\exp \\left(-\\frac{z \\mu}{k_{B} T}\\right)\n$$\n\nwith $v$ the microscopic vibration frequency. Within this model, the non Arrhenius behaviour of the relaxation time (see above) derives from the increase in the number of molecules that have to move cooperatively as temperature decreases, i.e. the $T$ dependence of $z$.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nMany fluids, whether simple liquids like argon or complex liquids such as colloids and polymers, can be quenched to temperatures well below their equilibrium freezing point without crystallization occurring on experimental timescales.
