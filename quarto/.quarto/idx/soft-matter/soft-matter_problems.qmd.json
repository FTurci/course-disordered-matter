Calculate the average distance from the origin along a given axis travelled by a particle in 1 minute due to Brownian motion and sedimentation, respectively. What are the displacements after 1 hour?\n\n### Equipartition\n\nThe equipartitioning theorem states that in thermal equilibrium each generalised co-ordinate which occurs in the total system energy only as a quadratic term contributes $(1 / 2) \\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{B}} \\mathrm{T}$ to the mean energy of the system. Use the theorem to estimate the typical time it rakes atoms (or small molecules) in an atomic liquid to move distances of the order of their own size, i.e. estimate the relaxation time.\n\n### Gravitational length\n\n(a) Find the typical length scale ('gravitational length') of the distribution of polystyrene particles (density $\\rho_{\\mathrm{p}}=1.05 \\times 10^{3} \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m}^{-3}$ ) of radius 50 nm and $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ respectively, suspended in water (density $\\rho_{\\mathrm{w}}=1.00 \\times 10^{3} \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m}^{-3}$, viscosity $1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~Pa} \\mathrm{~s}$ ) at room temperature.

Thus if the particle is raised a distance equal to its radius, the increase in its gravitational potential energy must be less than the thermal energy $(3 / 2) \\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{B}} T$. Another measure of the relative importance of the effects of Brownian motion and gravity, is the Peclet number $\\mathrm{Pe}=\\tau_{R} / \\tau_{\\text {sed }}$. Here $\\tau_{\\mathrm{R}}$ is the time taken by a particle to diffuse a distance equal to its radius, and $\\tau_{\\text {sed }}$ is the time taken by it to sediment the same distance. When $\\mathrm{Pe} \\ll 1$, Brownian motion dominates; when $\\mathrm{Pe} \\gg 1$, gravity dominates. Show that the\ncondition $\\mathrm{Pe}<1$ is more or less equivalent to the definition of a colloid given above.\n\n### Diffusion equation\n\nProve by direct substitution that $n(x, t)=C(4 \\pi D t)^{-1 / 2} \\exp \\left(-x^{2} / 4 D t\\right)$ is indeed a solution to the 1 D diffusion equation $\\partial n / \\partial t=D^{\\partial^{2} n} / \\partial x^{2}$.\nDiscuss the meaning of the constant C .\n\n### Mean square displacement\n\nStarting from the diffusion equation, deduce the mean square displacement, $\\left\\langle x^{2}\\right\\rangle=2 D t$, without using the full solution to the diffusion equation.\nNote that $n(x, t)$ is the number density, from which the probability density of finding a particle in the region $[\\mathrm{x}, \\mathrm{x}+\\mathrm{dx}]$ during the time interval $[\\mathrm{t}, \\mathrm{t}+\\mathrm{dt}]$, can be obtained by normalising with $\\int n(x, t) d x=N$ (the total number of particles). Having this in mind, the mean square displacement is\n$\\left\\langle x^{2}(t)\\right\\rangle=\\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^{2} n(x, t) d x}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} n(x, t) d x}=\\frac{1}{N} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^{2} n(x, t) d x$\nHint: Multiply both sides of the 1D diffusion equation by $x^{2}$ and integrate by parts over $x$ to get an o.d.e for $\\left\\langle x^{2}\\right\\rangle$ with t as the independent variable.\n\n### Relaxation time in colloidal suspensions\n\nUse $\\left\\langle\\underline{r}^{2}\\right\\rangle=6 D t$ and the Stokes-Einstein relation to show that the time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{R}}$ for a particle to diffuse its own radius $R$, scales as $R^{3}$. The relaxation time $\\tau_{R}$ is a good estimate for the time taken to return to equilibrium after a disturbance. Estimate $\\tau_{\\mathrm{R}}$ for a suspension of spheres of radius $\\mathrm{R} \\approx 1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, i.e. at the upper limit of the colloidal size range.\n\n### Colloidal crystals\n\nColloidal crystals are observed for volume fractions $\\phi$ between 0.545 and 0.74 . Show that the upper limit of $\\phi=0.74$ corresponds to the closest packing in a fcc crystal. What is the average distance between the colloidal particles for the lower limit $\\phi=0.545$ ? Hint: to get the average consider a simple cubic lattice of the same volume fraction\n\n### Lagrange's expression for the radius of gyration\n\nFor N equal point masses at positions $\\left\\{\\underline{R}_{j}\\right\\}$, the radius of gyration is defined by $R_{g}^{2}=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\left(\\underline{R}_{j}-\\underline{R}_{G}\\right)^{2}$ where $\\underline{R}_{G}=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\underline{R}_{j}$ is the position of the centre of mass. Show that\n\n$$\nR_{g}^{2}=\\frac{1}{2 N^{2}} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N}\\left(\\underline{R}_{j}-\\underline{R}_{k}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nHint: Note that $\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} 1=1$\n\n### Mean length\n\nCalculate the mean end-to end length of a freely jointed polymer consisting of $10^{5}$ monomers of length $4.322 \\AA$. How does the end-to-end length change if the valence angle of the chain is fixed at $108^{\\circ}$ ?\n\n### Real data\n\nLight scattering measurements on dilute solutions of polystyrene, of different molar masses M , at the theta temperature give the following results for the mean square radius of gyration $\\left\\langle R_{g}^{2}\\right\\rangle$ :\n\n| $\\mathrm{M}\\left(10^{6} \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\\right)$ | 4.04 | 1.56 | 1.20 | 1.06 | 0.626 | 0.394 |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $<R_{g}^{2}>\\left(\\mathrm{nm}^{2}\\right)$ | 3260 | 1210 | 928 | 770 | 484 | 305 |\n\n(a) Show that these results are consistent with $\\left\\langle R_{g}^{2}\\right\\rangle^{1 / 2}=B M^{1 / 2} \\quad\\left(M=N M_{M}\\right.$ where $N$ is the number of monomers in the chain and $M_{M}$ is the molar mass of one monomer; $M_{M}=100 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ ) and estimate the value of $B$.\n(b) Given that the 'size' of a styrene monomer is about $\\mathrm{b}_{0}=0.23 \\mathrm{~nm}$, calculate the factor $C$ which represents the effect of restricted bond angles in $\\left\\langle R^{2}\\right\\rangle=C N b_{0}^{2}$. From $C$, calculate the bond angle $\\theta$ which would apply if polystyrene can be represented by a freely-rotating chain. [Remember $\\left.\\left\\langle R_{g}^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\frac{1}{6}<R^{2}\\right\\rangle$ ]\n(c) Calculate $\\left.<R_{g}^{2}\\right\\rangle^{1 / 2}$ for a polystyrene chain of molar mass $1 \\times 10^{7} \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ at the theta temperature.\n(d) For the chain of (c), estimate the fraction of the volume $\\left.(4 \\pi / 3)<R_{g}^{2}\\right\\rangle^{3 / 2}$ which is actually occupied by styrene monomers (assume that the density of\nstyrene when polymerised is about $1 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ ).
