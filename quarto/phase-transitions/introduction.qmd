# Introduction to phase behaviour

A phase transition can be defined as a macroscopic rearrangment of the internal constituents of a system in response to a change in the thermodynamic conditions to
which they are subject. A wide variety of physical systems undergo such transitions. Understanding the properties of phase transitions is fundamental to the study of soft and complex matter, as these systems often exhibit rich and subtle transformations between different states of organization. Whether in colloidal suspensions, polymer blends, liquid crystals, or biological materials, phase transitions underpin a wide range of physical behaviours, from self-assembly and pattern formation to critical phenomena and dynamical arrest. By analysing how macroscopic phases emerge from microscopic interactions and external conditions, one gains crucial insight into the principles that govern structure, stability, and functionality in these intricate systems. As such, an understanding of phase transitions not only enriches theoretical understanding but also informs practical applications across materials science, biophysics, and nanotechnology. For these reasons we will devote a large proportion of this course to the study of phase transitions. 

Two classic examples of systems displaying phase transitions are the ferromagnet and fluid systems. As the
temperature of a ferromagnet is increased, its magnetic moment is observed to decrease smoothly, until at a certain temperature known as
the critical temperature, it vanishes altogether. We define the magnetisation to be the *order parameter* of this phase transition.

Similarly, a change of state from liquid to gas can be induced in a
fluid system (though not in an ideal gas) simply by raising the
temperature. Typically the liquid-vapour transition is abrupt,
reflecting the large number density difference between the states either side
of the transition. However the abruptness of this transition can be
reduced by applying pressure. At one particular pressure and temperature
the discontinuity in the density difference between the two states
vanishes and the two phases coalesce. These conditions of pressure and temperature serve to locate
the critical point for the fluid. We define the density difference $\rho_{liq}-\rho_{vap}$ 
to be the order parameter for the liquid-gas phase transition. We shall meet order parameters for other, more complex, systems in @sec-landau-theory,

In the vicinity of a critical point, a system displays a host of remarkable behaviors known as *critical phenomena*.
 Chief among these is the divergence of thermal response functions—such as specific heat, compressibility, or
  magnetic susceptibility—which signal an enhanced sensitivity to external perturbations. 
  These singularities arise from the emergence of large-scale cooperative interactions among the system’s
   microscopic constituents, leading to a diverging correlation length. One visually striking manifestation of this is 
   *critical opalescence*, particularly observed in fluids like CO$_2$. 
   As carbon dioxide nears its critical temperature and pressure, the distinction between its liquid and gas phases vanishes, 
   giving rise to huge fluctuations in density. These fluctuations scatter visible light, rendering the fluid milky 
   or opalescent. This scattering effect directly reflects the long-range correlations developing within the fluid. 
   The movie below illustrates the effect as the critical temperature of CO$_2$ is approached from above. 
   Note the appearence of a liquid-vapour interface (meniscus) as the system enters the two-phase region.

The recalcitrant problem posed by the critical region is how best to
incorporate such collective effects within the framework of a rigorous
mathematical theory that affords both physical insight and quantitative
explanation of the observed phenomena. This matter has been (and still
is!) the subject of intense theoretical activity.

The importance of the critical point stems largely from the fact that
many of the phenomena observed in its vicinity are believed to be common
to a whole range of apparently quite disparate physical systems. Systems
such as liquid mixtures, superconductors, liquid crystals, ferromagnets,
antiferromagnets and molecular crystals may display identical behaviour
near criticality. This observation implies a profound underlying
similarity among physical systems at criticality, regardless of many
aspects of their distinctive microscopic nature. These ideas have found
formal expression in the so-called 'universality hypothesis' which,
since its inception in the 1970s, has enjoyed considerable success.

In the next few lectures, principal aspects of the contemporary theoretical
viewpoint of phase transitions and critical phenomena will be reviewed.
Mean field theories of phase transitions will be discussed and their
inadequacies in the critical region will be exposed. The phenomenology
of the critical region will we described including power laws, critical
exponents and their relationship to scaling phenomena. These will be set
within the context of the powerful renormalisation group technique. The
notion of universality as a phenomenological hypothesis will be
introduced and its implications for real and model systems will be
explored. Finally, the utility of finite-size scaling methods for
computer studies of critical phenomena will be discussed, culminating in
the introduction of a specific technique suitable for exposing
universality in model systems.
