### Interaction of two charged colloidal spheres

> Adapted from J Dhont, K, Kang (1996) *An Introduction to Dynamics of Colloids*. Elsevier.

Consider a colloidal particle of total charge $Q$ located at the origin, immersed in a solvent of permittivity $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r$. The solvent contains a symmetric electrolyte with two mobile ionic species:

-   Cations of charge $+ze$ and bulk concentration $n_0$,
-   Anions of charge $-ze$ and bulk concentration $n_0$.

1.  Show that The mean electrostatic potential $\phi(\mathbf{r})$ satisfies Poisson’s equation: $$
    \nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{1}{\varepsilon} \left[ z e\, n_+(\mathbf{r}) - z e\, n_-(\mathbf{r}) + Q \delta(\mathbf{r}) \right].
    $$

    Assuming the ions form an ideal gas in thermal equilibrium, their local densities follow Boltzmann distributions: $$
    n_+(\mathbf{r}) = n_0 \exp[-\beta z e\, \phi(\mathbf{r})], \qquad
    n_-(\mathbf{r}) = n_0 \exp[+\beta z e\, \phi(\mathbf{r})], $$ where $\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.

2.  Use these expressions to obtain the (simplified) *nonlinear Poisson–Boltzmann equation* : $$
    \nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{2 z e n_0}{\varepsilon} \sinh\big(\beta z e\, \phi(\mathbf{r})\big) - \frac{Q}{\varepsilon}\delta(\mathbf{r}).
    $$

3.  Find physical conditions to linearise the equation.

4.  Solve the resulting linear equation for spherical symmetry to obtain the screened Coulomb (Debye–Hückel) potential: $$
    \phi(r) = \frac{Q}{4\pi \varepsilon} \frac{e^{-\kappa r}}{r},
    \qquad \kappa^2 = \frac{2 n_0 z^2 e^2}{\varepsilon k_B T}.
    $$

The parameter $\kappa^{-1}$ is the Debye screening length, and the solution shows that ionic screening converts the long-range Coulomb potential into a short-range Yukawa potential.

The following real to Fourier spcace mappings may be useful

## Solution

We start by considering a single colloidal particle of total charge $Q$ located at the origin, immersed in a solvent characterized by a permittivity $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r$. The solvent contains a symmetric electrolyte composed of two mobile ionic species: cations of charge $+ze$ and bulk concentration $n_0$, and anions of charge $-ze$ with the same bulk concentration $n_0$. The overall system is globally electroneutral in the bulk, so the net ionic charge far from the colloid is zero. The presence of the charged colloid generates an electrostatic potential $\phi(\mathbf{r})$ in the surrounding medium.

The mean electrostatic potential satisfies Poisson’s equation, which relates the divergence of the electric field to the local charge density. In this system, the total charge density consists of the fixed colloidal charge, represented by $Q \delta(\mathbf{r})$, and the contribution from the mobile ions, which depends on their local concentrations. This gives $$
\nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{1}{\varepsilon} \left[ z e\, n_+(\mathbf{r}) - z e\, n_-(\mathbf{r}) + Q \delta(\mathbf{r}) \right].
$$

To relate the ionic densities to the electrostatic potential, we assume the ions behave as an ideal gas in thermal equilibrium. Each ion experiences a potential energy proportional to its charge times the local potential, $U_\pm(\mathbf{r}) = \pm z e \phi(\mathbf{r})$. In equilibrium, the number density of each species follows the Boltzmann distribution, so the cation and anion densities are $$
n_+(\mathbf{r}) = n_0 \exp[-\beta z e\, \phi(\mathbf{r})], \qquad n_-(\mathbf{r}) = n_0 \exp[+\beta z e\, \phi(\mathbf{r})],
$$ where $\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse thermal energy. This captures the intuitive fact that cations are repelled by positive potentials and attracted to negative potentials, while anions behave oppositely.

Substituting these expressions for $n_+$ and $n_-$ into Poisson’s equation yields $$
\nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{1}{\varepsilon} \Big[ z e n_0 e^{-\beta z e \phi} - z e n_0 e^{\beta z e \phi} + Q \delta(\mathbf{r}) \Big].
$$ The difference of exponentials can be written as twice a hyperbolic sine, leading to the nonlinear Poisson–Boltzmann equation $$
\nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{2 z e n_0}{\varepsilon} \sinh\big(\beta z e\, \phi(\mathbf{r})\big) - \frac{Q}{\varepsilon}\delta(\mathbf{r}).
$$ This equation describes how the potential generated by the colloid is screened by the surrounding ions. The nonlinearity arises because the ionic response depends exponentially on the potential itself.

The equation can be linearized under the condition that the potential is small compared to the thermal voltage, specifically when $|\beta z e \phi(\mathbf{r})| \ll 1$. In this limit, the hyperbolic sine can be approximated by its argument

$$\sinh(\beta z e \phi) \approx \beta z e \phi.$$

The Poisson–Boltzmann equation then reduces to a **linear** differential equation

$$
\nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) - \kappa^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{Q}{\varepsilon} \delta(\mathbf{r}),
$$

where the inverse Debye length $\kappa$ is defined by

$$
\kappa^2 = \frac{2 n_0 z^2 e^2}{\varepsilon k_B T}.
$$

This linearized equation is known as the Debye–Hückel equation and describes the potential around a point charge in a screening medium.

This can be solved in Fourier space using the relations:

| Real space                      | Fourier space               |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| $f(\mathbf{r})$                 | $f(\mathbf{k})$             |
| $\nabla^2 f(\mathbf{r})$        | $-k^2 f(\mathbf{k})$        |
| $\delta(\mathbf{r})$            | $1$                         |
| $\dfrac{e^{-\kappa r}}{4\pi r}$ | $\dfrac{1}{k^2 + \kappa^2}$ |

This gives

$$
\phi(r) = \frac{Q}{4\pi \varepsilon} \frac{e^{-\kappa r}}{r}.
$$ At short distances ($r \ll \kappa^{-1}$), the potential reduces to the familiar Coulomb form, while at larger distances it decays exponentially due to ionic screening. The characteristic decay length $\kappa^{-1}$ is the Debye screening length, which increases with decreasing ionic strength and temperature. This solution illustrates how the electrolyte effectively screens the electrostatic interactions between colloidal particles, converting the long-range Coulomb potential into a short-range interaction that governs the stability and dynamics of colloidal suspensions.

**Note.** In the linearised regime, the Poisson-Boltzmann equation reads

$$
\nabla^2 \phi-\kappa^2 \phi=-\frac{Q}{\varepsilon} \delta(\mathbf{r})
$$

A similar equation exists in field theory for a massive scalar field $\Phi(\mathbf{r})$: it is the Klein-Gordon equation in Euclidean space

$$
\left(-\nabla^2+m^2\right) \Phi(\mathbf{r})=J(\mathbf{r})
$$

It is easy to identify the field the mass and the source with the respective static potential field, the Debye screening parameter and the point charge. The Yukawa potential is then simply the **propagator** (the Green's function).

### Second virial coefficient for depletion interactions

Consider a dilute suspension of spherical colloidal particles of radius $R_c$ in a solution of small ideal polymer coils of radius $R_p \ll R_c$. The polymers are non-adsorbing and behave as an ideal gas outside the colloids. The colloids interact via the **Asakura–Oosawa depletion potential** $U_{\rm AO}(r)$:

$$
U_{\rm AO}(r) =
\begin{cases}
\infty, & r < 2 R_c \\[2mm]
-\Pi\, V_{\rm overlap}(r), & 2 R_c \le r \le 2 R_c + 2 R_p \\[1mm]
0, & r > 2 R_c + 2 R_p
\end{cases}
$$

where $r$ is the center-to-center distance, $\Pi = n_p k_B T$ is the so called *osmotic pressure* of the polymer solution, and $V_{\rm overlap}(r)$ is the overlap volume of the depletion zones, given by

$$
V_{\text {overlap }}(r)=\frac{\pi\left(4 R_{\mathrm{eff}}+r\right)\left(2 R_{\mathrm{eff}}-r\right)^2}{12},
$$

with $R_{eff} = R_c+R_p$.

1.  Write the expression for the *second virial coefficient* $B_2$ in terms of the interaction potential:

    $$
     B_2 = -2 \pi \int_0^\infty \left( e^{-\beta U_{\rm AO}(r)} - 1 \right) r^2 dr
     $$

2.  Assuming the polymer-induced attraction is *weak* ($\beta |U_{\rm AO}(r)| \ll 1$) and that the polymers are much smaller than the colloids, expand the exponential to first order and simplify the integral.

3.  Express the resulting $B_2$ in terms of $R_c$, $R_p$, and the polymer osmotic pressure $\Pi$.

4.  Discuss qualitatively how $B_2$ depends on polymer concentration and size, and explain what a **negative** $B_2$ implies for colloidal aggregation.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Solution

The second virial coefficient $B_2$ measures the effective two-body contribution to the pressure of a dilute colloidal suspension, following the virial expansion. It is defined for a pairwise potential $U(r)$ as:

$$
B_2 = -2\pi \int_0^\infty \left( e^{-\beta U(r)} - 1 \right) r^2 dr.
$$

Here, $U(r) = U_{\mathrm{ AO}}(r)$ is the Asakura–Oosawa depletion potential.

1.  Rewrite $B_2$

    The AO potential has three regions:

    -   Hard-core region ($r < 2 R_c$), where $U = \infty \rightarrow e^{-\beta U} = 0$. The integrand becomes $-1$, giving contribution:

    $$
    B_2^{\mathrm HC} = -2\pi \int_0^{2R_c} (-1) r^2 dr = 2\pi \int_0^{2R_c} r^2 dr = \frac{16\pi}{3} R_c^3,
    $$

    which is just the hard-sphere contribution.

    -   Depletion region ($2R_c \le r \le 2R_c + 2 R_p$), where $U(r) = -\Pi V_{\mathrm overlap}(r)$.

    -   No interaction ($r > 2R_c + 2 R_p$), where $U = 0 \rightarrow e^{-\beta U} - 1 = 0$.

The overlap is written as (lecture notes) $$
V_{\text {overlap }}(r)=\frac{4 \pi}{3} R_d^3\left[1-\frac{3}{4} \frac{r}{R_d}+\frac{1}{16}\left(\frac{r}{R_d}\right)^3\right], \quad r \leq R_d=2R_c+2R_p
$$

and can be shown to be equivalent to

$$
V_{\text {overlap }}(r)=\frac{\pi\left(4 R_{\mathrm{eff}}+r\right)\left(2 R_{\mathrm{eff}}-r\right)^2}{12}
$$

So the integral reduces to contributions from $r < 2R_c$ (hard core) and $2R_c \le r \le 2R_c + 2R_p$ (depletion).

2.  Linearize the exponential. For weak polymer-induced attraction, $\beta |U| = \beta \Pi V_{\mathrm overlap} \ll 1$, we can expand:

$$
e^{-\beta U(r)} \approx 1 - \beta U(r) = 1 + \beta \Pi V_{\mathrm overlap}(r).
$$

Then the integrand in the depletion region becomes:

$$
-(e^{-\beta U} - 1) \approx -\beta \Pi V_{\mathrm overlap}(r).
$$

So the contribution to $B_2$ from the depletion region is:

$$
B_2^{\mathrm dep} = -2\pi \int_{2R_c}^{2R_c + 2R_p} \big( e^{-\beta U} - 1 \big) r^2 dr \approx -2\pi \beta \Pi \int_{2R_c}^{2R_c + 2R_p} V_{\mathrm overlap}(r) r^2 dr.
$$

3.  Express $B_2$ in terms of $R_c$, $R_p$, $\Pi$

Combining the hard-core and depletion contributions, the second virial coefficient is

$$
B_2 = \frac{16\pi}{3} R_c^3 - 2\pi \beta \Pi \int_{2R_c}^{2R_c + 2R_p} V_{\mathrm{overlap}}(r)\, r^2 dr
$$

We then calculate the second integral we just need to choose how to represent the overlap. We use the second expression above and leverage the fact that $R_p \ll R_c$ and that then the integral runs over $r=2R_C+x$ with $x\in[0,2R_p]$, so with $x$ clearly subleading

So, then

$$
4R_{\mathrm eff}+r = 6 R_c+4 R_p+x
$$

and

$$
2R_{\mathrm eff}-r = 2R_c+2R_p-2R_c-x= 2R_p-x
$$

So together

$$
V_{\mathrm overlap}(x) = \dfrac{\pi(6R_c+4R_p+x)(2R_p-x)^2}{12}
$$

dropping subleading contributions leads to $$
V_{\mathrm overlap}(x) \approx \dfrac{6\pi R_c(2R_p-x)^2}{12}
$$

Then, we rewrite 

$$\int_{2R_c}^{2R_c + 2R_p} V_{\mathrm{overlap}}(r)\, r^2 dr$$

as
$$\int_{0}^{2R_p} V_{\mathrm{overlap}}(x)\, (2R_c+x)^2  dx$$

and approximate as 
$$ \approx (2 R_c)^2 \int_{0}^{2R_p } V_{\mathrm{overlap}}(x)dx$$

and then

$$
B_2\approx  \frac{16\pi}{3} R_c^3  -2 \pi \beta \Pi\left(2 R_c\right)^2 \int_0^{2  R_p} \frac{\pi}{2} R_c\left(2 R_p-x\right)^2 d x
$$

So we finally integrate 

$$
\int_0^{2 R_p}\left(2 R_p-x\right)^2 d x
$$

via a change of variable $y=2 R_p-x$

$$
\int_0^{2 R_p}\left(2 R_p-x\right)^2 d x=\int_{2 R_p}^0 y^2(-d y)=\int_0^{2 R_p} y^2 d y=\frac{\left(2 R_p\right)^3}{3}=\frac{8 R_p^3}{3}
$$

which leads to

$$
B_2 \approx\frac{16\pi}{3} R_c^3 -\frac{32 \pi^2}{3} \beta \Pi R_c^3 R_p^3
$$

where $R_c$ is the colloid radius, $R_p$ is the polymer radius, $\Pi$ is the osmotic pressure of the polymer solution, and $V_{\mathrm{overlap}}(r)$ is the overlap volume between two colloids at separation $r$. This formula shows how $B_2$ depends explicitly on $R_c$, $R_p$, and $\Pi$.

4.  Physical interpretation

-   $B_2$ **decreases** with increasing polymer concentration (via $\Pi$) and polymer size ($R_p$).
-   When the depletion attraction is strong enough, $B_2$ can become **negative**, which signals that attractive interactions dominate over repulsion.
-   Negative $B_2$ implies a tendency for **colloidal aggregation** or even phase separation, because the effective interaction favuors close approach of colloids.

### Brownian motion and sedimentation

Spherical colloidal particles of radius 30 nm and density $1.35 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ are suspended in water (temperature $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, density $1.0 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, viscosity $1.0 \times 10^{-3}$ Pa s ). 

The di

Calculate the average distance from the origin along a given axis traveled by a particle in 1 minute due to Brownian motion and sedimentation, respectively. What are the displacements after 1 hour?


## Equipartition

The equipartition theorem states that in thermal equilibrium each generalised co-ordinate which occurs in the total system energy only as a quadratic term contributes $(1 / 2) \mathrm{k}_{\mathrm{B}} \mathrm{T}$ to the mean energy of the system. Use the theorem to estimate the typical time it rakes atoms (or small molecules) in an atomic liquid to move distances of the order of their own size, i.e. estimate the relaxation time.

## Gravitational length

1. Find the typical length scale ('gravitational length') of the distribution of polystyrene particles (density $\rho_{\mathrm{p}}=1.05 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$ ) of radius 50 nm and $1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ respectively, suspended in water (density $\rho_{\mathrm{w}}=1.00 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$, viscosity $1.0 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~Pa} \mathrm{~s}$ ) at room temperature. Hint: The gravitational length is the height at which the concentration falls to $1 / \mathrm{e}$ of its greatest value.
2. If a container of height $\mathrm{H}=4 \mathrm{~cm}$ contains a dilute suspension of these particles at an average concentration of $n_{a}$ particles per unit volume, what are the actual concentrations (in terms of $n_{a}$ ) at the top and bottom of the sample when sedimentation equilibrium has been reached.
3. If the above sample is shaken up to give an initially uniform concentration and then left undisturbed, estimate how long it will take the concentration profile to reach its equilibrium state (A surprisingly long time!)

## Peclet number

A definition of a colloid is a particle small enough that its Brownian motion is not dominated by gravity. Thus if the particle is raised a distance equal to its radius, the increase in its gravitational potential energy must be less than the thermal energy $(3 / 2) \mathrm{k}_{\mathrm{B}} T$. Another measure of the relative importance of the effects of Brownian motion and gravity, is the Peclet number $\mathrm{Pe}=\tau_{R} / \tau_{\text {sed }}$. Here $\tau_{\mathrm{R}}$ is the time taken tau_{\text {sed }}$ is the time taken by it to sediment the same distance. When $\mathrm{Pe} \ll 1$, Brownian motion dominates; when $\mathrm{Pe} \gg 1$, gravity dominates. Show that the
condition $\mathrm{Pe}<1$ is more or less equivalent to the definition of a colloid given above.

## Diffusion equation

Prove by direct substitution that $n(x, t)=C(4 \pi D t)^{-1 / 2} \exp \left(-x^{2} / 4 D t\right)$ is indeed a solution to the 1 D diffusion equation $\partial n / \partial t=D^{\partial^{2} n} / \partial x^{2}$.
Discuss the meaning of the constant C .

## Mean square displacement

Starting from the diffusion equation, deduce the mean square displacement, $\left\langle x^{2}\right\rangle=2 D t$, without using the full solution to the diffusion equation.
Note that $n(x, t)$ is the number density, from which the probability density of finding a particle in the region $[\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{x}+\mathrm{dx}]$ during the time interval $[\mathrm{t}, \mathrm{t}+\mathrm{dt}]$, can be obtained by normalising with $\int n(x, t) d x=N$ (the total number of particles). Having this in mind, the mean square displacement is
$\left\langle x^{2}(t)\right\rangle=\frac{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^{2} n(x, t) d x}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} n(x, t) d x}=\frac{1}{N} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^{2} n(x, t) d x$
Hint: Multiply both sides of the 1D diffusion equation by $x^{2}$ and integrate by parts over $x$ to get an o.d.e for $\left\langle x^{2}\right\rangle$ with t as the independent variable.

## Relaxation time in colloidal suspensions

Use $\left\langle\underline{r}^{2}\right\rangle=6 D t$ and the Stokes-Einstein relation to show that the time $\tau_{\mathrm{R}}$ for a particle to diffuse its own radius $R$, scales as $R^{3}$. The relaxation time $\tau_{R}$ is a good estimate for the time taken to return to equilibrium after a disturbance. Estimate $\tau_{\mathrm{R}}$ for a suspension of spheres of radius $\mathrm{R} \approx 1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, i.e. at the upper limit of the colloidal size range.

## Colloidal crystals

Colloidal crystals are observed for volume fractions $\phi$ between 0.545 and 0.74 . Show that the upper limit of $\phi=0.74$ corresponds to the closest packing in a fcc crystal. What is the average distance between the colloidal particles for the lower limit $\phi=0.545$ ? Hint: to get the average consider a simple cubic lattice of the same volume fraction

## Lagrange's expression for the radius of gyration

For N equal point masses at positions $\left\{\underline{R}_{j}\right\}$, the radius of gyration is defined by $R_{g}^{2}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N}\left(\underline{R}_{j}-\underline{R}_{G}\right)^{2}$ where $\underline{R}_{G}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \underline{R}_{j}$ is the position of the centre of mass. Show that

$$
R_{g}^{2}=\frac{1}{2 N^{2}} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N}\left(\underline{R}_{j}-\underline{R}_{k}\right)^{2}
$$

Hint: Note that $\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} 1=1$

## Mean length

Calculate the mean end-to end length of a freely jointed polymer consisting of $10^{5}$ monomers of length $4.322 \AA$. How does the end-to-end length change if the valence angle of the chain is fixed at $108^{\circ}$ ?

## Real data

Light scattering measurements on dilute solutions of polystyrene, of different molar masses M , at the theta temperature give the following results for the mean square radius of gyration $\left\langle R_{g}^{2}\right\rangle$ :

| $\mathrm{M}\left(10^{6} \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right)$ | 4.04 | 1.56 | 1.20 | 1.06 | 0.626 | 0.394 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $<R_{g}^{2}>\left(\mathrm{nm}^{2}\right)$ | 3260 | 1210 | 928 | 770 | 484 | 305 |

(a) Show that these results are consistent with $\left\langle R_{g}^{2}\right\rangle^{1 / 2}=B M^{1 / 2} \quad\left(M=N M_{M}\right.$ where $N$ is the number of monomers in the chain and $M_{M}$ is the molar mass of one monomer; $M_{M}=100 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ ) and estimate the value of $B$.
(b) Given that the 'size' of a styrene monomer is about $\mathrm{b}_{0}=0.23 \mathrm{~nm}$, calculate the factor $C$ which represents the effect of restricted bond angles in $\left\langle R^{2}\right\rangle=C N b_{0}^{2}$. From $C$, calculate the bond angle $\theta$ which would apply if polystyrene can be represented by a freely-rotating chain. [Remember $\left.\left\langle R_{g}^{2}\right\rangle=\frac{1}{6}<R^{2}\right\rangle$ ]
(c) Calculate $\left.<R_{g}^{2}\right\rangle^{1 / 2}$ for a polystyrene chain of molar mass $1 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ at the theta temperature.
(d) For the chain of (c), estimate the fraction of the volume $\left.(4 \pi / 3)<R_{g}^{2}\right\rangle^{3 / 2}$ which is actually occupied by styrene monomers (assume that the density of
styrene when polymerised is about $1 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ ). What is the overlap concentration $c^{*}$ (in mass per volume)? How do you expect $c^{*}$ to change upon an increase (decrease) in temperature?

## Micelles

The volume of a linear hydrocarbon chain with $n$ carbon atoms is given by $v=(27.4+26.9 n) \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~nm}^{3}$, and its critical chain length is $l_{c}=(0.154+0.1265 n)$ $n m$. An amphiphile has an anionic head group with an optimum head group area in aqueous solution of $a_{0}=0.65 \mathrm{~nm}^{2}$.
(i) What shape micelles are formed by amphiphiles with linear hydrocarbon chains having $\mathrm{n}=10$ ?
(ii) What is the average size and aggregation number of each micelle?

## Viscosity

For polystyrene, the variation of viscosity with temperature follows the Vogel-Fulcher law $B=710$ and $T_{0}=50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Plot the function $\eta / \eta_{0}$ in the temperature range $80-150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. By what factor does the viscosity and relaxation time vary between the temperatures of $100-140^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ?

## The glass transition

For polystyrene, a relaxation time associated with configurational rearrangements, $\tau_{\text {config, }}$, follows a Vogel-Fulcher law,

$$
\tau_{\text {confg }}=\tau_{0} \exp \left(\frac{B}{T-T_{0}}\right)
$$

Where $\tau_{0}, \mathrm{~B}=710$ and $T_{0}=50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ are constants. A value of the experimental glass transition temperature is measured with an experiment carried out at an effective timescale $\tau_{\text {exp }}=1000$ s and found to be $101.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
(a) Another experiment is carried out at an effective timescale of $10^{5} \mathrm{~s}$. What is the value of the glass transition temperature obtained from this experiment?
(b) On what timescale must an experiment be carried out if it is to measure a glass transition temperature within $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ of the Vogel-Fulcher temperature $T_{0}$. Is this practically possible?
