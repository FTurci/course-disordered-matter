# The approach to criticality {#sec:approach}

It is a matter of experimental fact that the approach to criticality in
a given system is characterized by the divergence of various
thermodynamic observables. Let us remain with the archetypal example of
a critical system, the ferromagnet, whose critical temperature will be
denoted as $T_c$. For temperatures close to $T_c$, the magnetic response
functions (the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ and the specific heat) are
found to be singular functions, diverging as a *power* of the reduced
(dimensionless) temperature $t \equiv
(T-T_c)/T_c$:-

$$
\chi \equiv \frac{\partial M}{\partial H}\propto t^{-\gamma} ~~~~ (H=0) 
$${#eq-chipow}

(where $M=mN$),
$$
C_H \equiv \frac{\partial E}{\partial T}\propto t^{-\alpha} ~~~~ (H=\textrm{ constant}) 
$${#eq-Cv}

Another key quantity is the correlation length $\xi$, which measures the
distance over which fluctuations of the magnetic moments are correlated.
This is observed to diverge near the critical point with an exponent
$\nu$.

$$
\xi \propto t^{-\nu} ~~~~ (T > T_c,\: H=0)
$${#eq-corr}


Similar power law behaviour is found for the order parameter $Q$ (in
this case the magnetisation) which vanishes in a singular fashion (it
has infinite gradient) as the critical point is is approached as a
function of temperature:

$$
m \propto t^{\beta} ~~~~ (T < T_c,\: H=0) 
$${#eq-mag}
(here the symbol $\beta$, is not to be confused with $\beta=1/k_BT$--
this unfortunately is the standard notation.)

Finally, as a function of magnetic field:

$$m \propto h^{1/\delta} ~~~~ (T = T_c,\: |H|>0) .$${#eq-field}
with $h=(H-H_c)/H_c$, the reduced magnetic field.

As examples, the behaviour of the magnetisation and correlation length
are plotted in @fig-sing  as a function of $t$.

The quantities $\gamma, \alpha, \nu, \beta$ in the above equations are
known as critical exponents. They serve to control the rate at which the
various thermodynamic quantities change on the approach to criticality.

Remarkably, the form of singular behaviour observed at criticality for
the example ferromagnet also occurs in qualitatively quite different
systems such as the fluid. All that is required to obtain the
corresponding power law relationships for the fluid is to substitute the
analogous thermodynamic quantities in to the above equations.
Accordingly the magnetisation order parameter is replaced by the density
difference $\rho_{liq}-\rho_{gas}$ while the susceptibility is replaced
by the isothermal compressibility and the specific heat capacity at
constant field is replaced by the specific heat capacity at constant
volume. The approach to criticality in a variety of qualitatively quite
different systems can therefore be expressed in terms of a set of
critical exponents describing the power law behaviour for that system
(see the book by Yeomans for examples).

Even more remarkable is the experimental observation that the values of
the critical exponents for a whole range of fluids and magnets (and
indeed many other systems with critical points) are *identical*. This is
the phenomenon of *universality*. It implies a deep underlying physical
similarity between ostensibly disparate critical systems. The principal
aim of theories of critical point phenomena is to provide a sound
theoretical basis for the existence of power law behaviour, the factors
governing the observed values of critical exponents and the universality
phenomenon. Ultimately this basis is provided by the Renormalisation
Group (RG) theory, for which K.G. Wilson was awarded the Nobel Prize in
Physics in 1982.
