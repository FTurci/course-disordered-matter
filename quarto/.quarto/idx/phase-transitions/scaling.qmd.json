{"title":"The Static Scaling Hypothesis","markdown":{"headingText":"The Static Scaling Hypothesis","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\nHistorically, the first step towards properly elucidating near-critical\nbehaviour was taken with the static scaling hypothesis. This is\nessentially a plausible conjecture concerning the origin of power law\nbehaviour which appears to be consistent with observed phenomena.\nAccording to the hypothesis, the basis for power law behaviour (and\nassociated scale invariance or \"scaling\") in near-critical systems is\nexpressed in the claim that: in the neighbourhood of a critical point,\nthe basic thermodynamic functions (most notably the free energy) are\n*generalized homogeneous functions* of their variables. For such\nfunctions one can always deduce a scaling law such that by an\nappropriate change of scale, the dependence on two variables (e.g. the\ntemperature and applied field) can be reduced to dependence on one new\nvariable. This claim may be warranted by the following general argument.\n\nA function of two variables $g(u,v)$ is called a generalized homogeneous\nfunction if it has the property\n\n$$g(\\lambda^au,\\lambda^bv)=\\lambda g(u,v)$$ **for all $\\lambda$**, where\nthe parameters $a$ and $b$ (known as scaling parameters) are constants.\nAn example of such a function is $g(u,v)=u^3+v^2$ with $a=1/3, b=1/2$.\n\nNow, the arbitrary scale factor $\\lambda$ can be redefined without loss\nof generality as $\\lambda^a=u^{-1}$ giving\n\n$$g(u,v)=u^{1/a}g(1,\\frac{v}{u^{b/a}})$$ A corresponding relation is\nobtained by choosing the rescaling to be $\\lambda^b=v^{-1}$.\n\n$$\\label{eq:sca2}\ng(u,v)=v^{1/b}g(\\frac{u}{v^{a/b}},1)$$\n\nThis equation demonstrates that $g(u,v)$ indeed satisfies a simple power\nlaw in $\\it{one}$ variable, subject to the constraint that $u/v^{a/b}$\nis a constant. It should be stressed, however, that such a scaling\nrelation specifies neither the function $g$ nor the parameters $a$ and\n$b$.\n\nNow, the static scaling hypothesis asserts that in the critical region,\nthe free energy $F$ is a generalized homogeneous function of the\n(reduced) thermodynamic fields $t=(T-T_c)/T_c$ and $h=(H-H_c)$.\nRemaining with the example ferromagnet, the following scaling assumption\ncan then be made:\n\n$$F(\\lambda^a t,\\lambda^b h)=\\lambda F(t,h) \\:.\n\\label{eq:scagibbs}$$\n\nWithout loss of generality, we can set $\\lambda^a=t^{-1}$, implying\n$\\lambda=t^{-1/a}$ and $\\lambda^b=t^{-b/a}$.\n\nThen $$F(t,h)=t^{1/a}F(1,t^{-b/a}h)$$ where our choice of $\\lambda$\nensures that $F$ on the rhs is now a function of a single variable\n$t^{-b/a}h$.\n\nNow, as stated in @sec:background, the free energy provides the route to all\nthermodynamic functions of interest. An expression for the magnetisation\ncan be obtained simply by taking the field derivative of $F$ (cf. @fig-thermo)\n\n$$m(t,h)=-t^{(1-b)/a}m(1,t^{-b/a}h)\n$${#eq-magscale}\n\nIn zero applied field $h=0$, this reduces to\n\n$$m(t,0)=(-t)^{(1-b)/a}m(1,0)$$ where the r.h.s. is a power law in $t$.\n@eq-mag then allows identification of the exponent $\\beta$\nin terms of the scaling parameters $a$ and $b$.\n\n$$\\beta=\\frac{1-b}{a}$$\n\nBy taking further appropriate derivatives of the free energy, other\nrelations between scaling parameters and critical exponents may be\ndeduced. Such calculations (*Exercise: try to derive them*) yield the results $\\delta =\nb/(1-b)$,$\\gamma = (2b-1)/a$, and $\\alpha =(2a-1)/a$ . Relationships\nbetween the critical exponents themselves can be obtained trivially by\neliminating the scaling parameters from these equations. The principal\nresults (known as \"scaling laws\") are:-\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\alpha+\\beta(\\delta+1)=2 \\\\\n\\alpha+2\\beta+\\gamma=2\n\\end{aligned} Thus, provided all critical exponents can be expressed\nin terms of the scaling parameters $a$ and $b$, then only two critical\nexponents need be specified, for all others to be deduced. Of course\nthese scaling laws are also expected to hold for the appropriate\nthermodynamic functions of analogous systems such as the liquid-gas\ncritical point.\n\n## Experimental Verification of Scaling\n\nThe validity of the scaling hypothesis finds startling verification in\nexperiment. To facilitate contact with experimental data for real\nsystems, consider again @eq-magscale. Eliminating the scaling parameters $a$ and $b$\nin favour of the exponents $\\beta$ and $\\delta$ gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{m(t,h)}{t^{\\beta}}=m(1,\\frac{h}{t^{\\beta\\delta}})\n$$ where the RHS of this last equation can be regarded as a function of the single\nscaled variable $\\tilde{H} \\equiv t^{-\\beta\\delta} h(t,M)$.\n\nFor some particular magnetic system, one can perform an experiment in\nwhich one measures $m$ vs $h$ for various fixed temperatures. This\nallows one to draw a set of isotherms, i.e. $m-h$ curves of constant\n$t$. These can be used to demonstrate scaling by plotting the data\nagainst the scaling variables $M=t^{-\\beta}m(t,h)$ and\n$\\tilde{H}=t^{-\\beta\\delta}h(t,M)$. Under this scale transformation, it\nis found that all isotherms (for $t$ close to zero) coincide to within\nexperimental error. Reassuringly, similar results are found using the\nscaled equation of state of simple fluid systems such as He$^3$ or Xe.\n\n![Magnetisation of CrBr$_3$ in the critical region plotted in scaled form (see text). From [Ho and Lister (1969](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.22.603).](Figs/scaling.png){width=70% #fig-scalingexp }\n\nIn summary, the static scaling hypothesis is remarkably successful in\nproviding a foundation for the observation of power laws and scaling\nphenomena. However, it furnishes little or no guidance regarding the\nrole of co-operative phenomena at the critical point. In particular it\nprovides no means for calculating the values of the critical exponents\nappropriate to given model systems.\n\n## Computer simulation {#sec-compsim}\n\nIn seeking to employ simulation to obtain estimates of bulk critical\npoint properties (such as the location of a critical point and the\nvalues of its associated exponents), one is immediately confronted with\na difficulty. The problem is that simulations are necessarily restricted\nto dealing with systems of finite-size and cannot therefore accommodate\nthe truly long ranged fluctuations that characterize the near-critical\nregime. As a consequence, the critical singularities in $C_v$, order\nparameter, etc. appear rounded and shifted in a simulation study. @fig-shift\nshows a schematic example for the susceptibility of a magnet.\n\n![Schematic of the near-critical temperature dependence of the magnet susceptibility in a finite-sized system.](Figs/shift.png){width=60% #fig-shift}\n \nThus the position of the peak in a response function (such as $C_v$)\nmeasured for a finite-sized system does not provide an accurate estimate\nof the critical temperature. Although the degree of rounding and\nshifting reduces with system size, it is often the case, that\ncomputational constraints prevent access to the largest system sizes\nwhich would provide accurate estimates of critical parameters. To help\ndeal with this difficulty, finite-size scaling (FSS) methods have been\ndeveloped to allow extraction of bulk critical properties from\nsimulations of finite size. FSS will be discussed\nin
