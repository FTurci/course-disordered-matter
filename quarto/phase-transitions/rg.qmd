# The Renormalisation Group Theory of Critical Phenomena

*Owing the the absence of a wholly appropriate textbook for the material
covered in this section, I have supplied more detailed notes than used
in other parts of the unit.*

The critical region is characterised by correlated microstructure on
$\underline{all}$ length-scales up to and including the correlation
length. Such a profusion of degrees of freedom can only be accurately
characterized by a very large number of variables. Mean field theories
and approximation schemes fail in the critical region because they at
best incorporate interactions among only a few spins, while neglecting
correlations over larger distances. Similarly, the scaling hypothesis
fails to provide more than a qualitative insight into the nature of
criticality because it focuses on only one length-scale, namely the
correlation length itself. Evidently a fuller understanding of the
critical region may only be attained by taking account of the existence
of structure on all length-scales. Such a scheme is provided by the
renormalisation group method, which stands today as the cornerstone of
the modern theory of critical phenomena.

## The critical point: A many length scale problem

A near critical system can be characterized by three important length
scales, namely

1.  The correlation length, $\xi$, ie the size of correlated
    microstructure.

2.  Minimum length scale $L_\textrm{ min}$, i.e. the smallest length in the
    microscopics of the problem, e.g. lattice spacing of a magnet or the
    particle size in a fluid.

3.  Macroscopic size $L_{max}$ eg. size of the system.

The authentic critical region is defined by a window condition:

$$L_\textrm{ max} \gg \xi \gg L_\textrm{ min}$$

The physics of this regime is hard to tackle by analytic theory because
it is characterized by configurational structure on all scales between
$L_\textrm{ min}$ and $\xi$ (in fact it turns out that the near critical
configurational patterns are *fractal*-like, cf.
fig. [5](#fig:snapshots){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:snapshots"}(b)). Moreover different length scales are
correlated with one another, giving rise to a profusion of coupled
variables in any theoretical description. The window regime is also not
easily accessed by computer simulation because it entails studying very
large system sizes $L_\textrm{
max}$, often requiring considerable computing resources.

## Methodology of the RG {#sec:rgmethod}

The central idea of the renormalisation group (RG) method is a stepwise
elimination of the degrees of freedom of the system on successively
larger length-scales. To achieve this one introduces a fourth length
scale $L$. In contrast to the other three, which characterize the system
itself, $L$ characterises the *description* of the system. It may be
thought of as typifying the size of the smallest resolvable detail in a
description of the system's microstructure.

Consider the Ising model arrangements displayed in
fig. [5](#fig:snapshots){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:snapshots"}(a)-(c). These pictures contain *all* the
details of each configuration shown: the resolution length $L$ in this
case has its smallest possible value, coinciding with the lattice
spacing i.e. $L=L_{\min}$. In the present context, the most detailed
description is not the most useful: the essential signals with which we
are concerned are hidden in a noise of relevant detail. A clue to
eliminating this noise lies in the nature of the correlation length,
i.e. the size of the largest droplets. The explicit form of the small
scale microstructure is irrelevant to the behaviour of $\xi$. The small
scale microstructure is the noise. To eliminate it, we simply select a
larger value of the resolution length (or 'coarse-graining' length) $L$.

There are many ways of implementing this coarse-graining procedure. We
adopt a simple strategy in which we divide our sample into blocks of
side $L$, each of which contains $L^d$ sites, with $d$ the space
dimensions . The centres of the blocks define a lattice of points
indexed by $I=1,2,....,N/L^d$. We associate with each block lattice
point centre, $I$, a coarse-grained or block variable $S_I(L)$ defined
as the spatial average of the local variables it contains:

$$S_I(L)=L^{-d}\sum_i^Is_i
\label{eq:blkvar}$$ where the sum extends over the $L^d$ sites in the
block $I$. The set of coarse grained coordinates $\{S(L)\}$ are the
basic ingredients of a picture of the system having spatial resolution
of order $L$.

The coarse graining operation is easily implemented on a computer. In so
doing one is faced with the fact that while the underlying Ising spins
can only take two possible values, the block variables $S_I(L)$ have
$L^d+1$ possible values. Accordingly in displaying the consequences of
the blocking procedure, we need a more elaborate colour convention than
that used in fig. [5](#fig:snapshots){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:snapshots"}. We will associate with each block a shade of
grey drawn from a spectrum ranging from black to white.

![See text for details](Figs/coarseconf1.jpg){#fig:c1 width=80%}

The results of coarse-graining configurations typical of three different
temperatures are shown in fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:c1"} and fig. [16](#fig:c2){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:c2"}. Two auxiliary operations are implicit in these
results. The first operation is a *length scaling*: the lattice spacing
on each blocked lattice has been scaled to the same size as that of the
original lattice, making possible the display of correspondingly larger
portions of the physical system. The second operation is a *variable
scaling*: loosely speaking, we have adjusted the scale ('contrast') of
the block variable so as to match the spectrum of block variable values
to the spectrum of shades at our disposal.

Consider first a system marginally above its critical point at a
temperature $T$ chosen so that the correlation length $\xi$ is
approximately 6 lattice spacing units. A typical arrangement (without
coarse-graining) is shown in fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:c1"}(ai). The succeeding figures,
 [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c1"}(aii) and
 [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c1"}(aiii), show the
result of coarse-graining with block sizes $L=4$ and $L=8$,
respectively. A clear trend is apparent. The coarse-graining *amplifies*
the consequences of the small deviation of $T$ from $T_c$. As $L$ is
increased, the ratio of the size of the largest configurational features
($\xi$) to the size of the smallest ($L$) is reduced. The ratio $\xi/L$
provides a natural measure of how 'critical' is a configuration. Thus
the coarse-graining operation generates a representation of the system
that is effectively less critical the larger the coarse-graining length.
The limit point of this trend is the effectively fully disordered
arrangement shown in fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:c1"}(aiii) and in an alternative form in
fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c1"}(aiv), which
shows the limiting distribution of the coarse grained variables,
averaged over many realizations of the underlying configurations: the
distribution is a Gaussian which is narrow (even more so the larger the
$L$ value) and centred on zero. This limit is easily understood. When
the system is viewed on a scaled $L$ larger than $\xi$, the correlated
microstructure is no longer explicitly apparent; each coarse-grained
variable is essentially independent of the others.

A similar trend is apparent below the critical point.
Fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c1"}(bi) show a
typical arrangement at a temperature $T<T_c$ such that again $\xi$ is
approximately $6$ lattice spacings. Coarse-graining with $L=4$ and $L=8$
again generates representations which are effectively less critical
(figs. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c1"}(bii) and
(biii)). This time the coarse-graining smoothes out the microstructure
which makes the order incomplete. The limit point of this procedure is a
homogeneously ordered arrangement in which the block variables have a
random (Gaussian) distribution centred on the order parameter
(fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c1"}(biv)).

Consider now the situation *at* the critical point.
Fig. [16](#fig:c2){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c2"}(ai) shows a
typical arrangement; figs.  [16](#fig:c2){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:c2"}(aii) and (aiii) show the results of coarse-graining
with $L=4$ and $L=8$ respectively. Since the $\xi$ is as large as the
system itself the coarse graining does not produce less critical
representations of the physical system: each of the figures displays
structure over *all* length scales between the lower limit set by $L$
and the upper limit set by the size of the display itself. A limiting
trend is nevertheless apparent. Although the $L=4$ pattern is
qualitatively quite different from the pattern of the local variables,
the $L=4$ and $L=8$ patterns display qualitatively similar features.
These similarities are more profound than is immediately apparent. A
statistical analysis of the spectrum of $L=4$ configurations (generated
as the local variables evolve in time) show that it is almost identical
to that of the $L=8$ configurations (given the block variable scaling).
The implication of this limiting behaviour is clear: the patterns formed
by the ordering variable at criticality look the same (in a statistical
sense) when viewed on all sufficiently large length scales.

![See text for details](Figs/coarseconf2.png){#fig:c2 width=80%}

Let us summarize. Under the coarse-graining operation there is an
evolution or *flow* of the system's configuration spectrum. The flow
tends to a limit, or fixed point, such that the pattern spectrum does
not change under further coarse-graining. These scale-invariant limits
have a trivial character for $T>T_c$, (a perfectly disordered
arrangement) and $T
< T_c$, (a perfectly ordered arrangement). The hallmark of the critical
point is the existence of a scale-invariant limit which is neither fully
ordered nor fully disordered but which possesses structure on all length
scales.

## Universality and Scaling

Equipped with the coarse-graining technique, we now address the
universality phenomenon. We aim to understand how it is that systems
that are different microscopically can nevertheless display critical
point behaviour which (in certain respects) is quantitatively identical.

To obtain initial insight we introduce a spin-1 Ising model in which the
spins take on three values ($s_i=1,0,-1$), in contrast to the two values
($s_i=1,-1$) of the spin-1/2 Ising model. The two models have properties
which are different: for example, $T_c$ for the three-state model is
some $30\%$ lower than that of the two-state model (for the same
coupling $J$). However, there is abundant evidence that the two models
have the same universal properties.

Let us explore what is the same and what is different in the
configurations of the two models at criticality. The configurations of
the local variables $s_i$ are clearly qualitatively different for the
two models. Now consider the coarse-grained configurations (with $L=4$
and $L=8$ respectively) for the three-state model at the critical point.
We have already seen that the coarse-graining operation bears the
configuration spectrum of the critical two-state Ising model to a
non-trivial scale-invariant limit. It is scarcely surprising that the
same is true for the three-state model. What is remarkable is that the
two limits are the same! This is expressed in
fig. [16](#fig:c2){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c2"}(iv), which
shows the near coincidence of the distribution of block variables
(grey-levels) for the two different coarse-graining lengths. Thus the
coarse-graining erases the physical differences apparent in
configurations where the local behaviour is resolvable, and exposes a
profound configurational similarity.

### Fluid-magnet universality

Let us now turn to fluid-magnet universality. In a magnet, the relevant
configurations are those formed by the coarse-grained magnetisation (the
magnetic moment averaged over a block of side $L$). In a fluid, the
relevant configurations are those of the coarse-grained density (the
mass averaged over a block if side $L$) or more precisely, its
fluctuation from its macroscopic average
(Fig. [17](#fig:fmcoarse){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:fmcoarse"}). The patterns in the latter (bubbles of
liquid or vapour) may be matched to pattern in the former (microdomains
of the magnetisation), given appropriate scaling operations to
camouflage the differences between the length scales and the differences
between the variable scales.

## Near critical scaling

The similarity of coarse-grained configurations of different systems is
not restricted to the critical temperature itself. Suppose we have a two
state spin model and a three state spin model each somewhat above their
critical points at reduced temperature $t$. The two systems will have
somewhat different correlation lengths, $\xi_1$ and $\xi_2$ say. Suppose
however, we choose coarse-graining lengths $L_1$ for $L_2$ for the two
models such that $\xi_1/L_1=\xi_2/L_2$. We adjust the scales of the
block variables (our grey level control) so that the typical variable
value is the same for the two systems. We adjust the length scale of the
systems (stretch or shrink our snapshots) so that the sizes of the
minimum-length-scale structure (set by $L_1$ and $L_2$) looks the same
for each system. Precisely what they look like depends upon our choice
of $\xi/L$.

## Universality classes {#sec:unipics}

Coarse graining does not erase all differences between the physical
properties of critical systems. Differences in the space dimension $d$
of two critical systems will lead to different universal properties such
as critical exponents. Thus, for instance, the critical exponents of the
2D magnet, match those of the 2d fluid, but they are different to those
of 3d magnets and fluids.

In fact the space dimension is one of a small set of qualitative
features of a critical system which are sufficiently deep-seated to
survive coarse graining and which together serve to define the system's
universal behaviour, or *universality class*. The constituents of this
set are not all identifiable *a priori*. They include the number of
components $n$ of the order parameter. Up to now, we have only
considered order parameters which are scalar (for a fluid the density,
for a magnet the magnetisation), for which $n=1$. In some ferromagnets,
the order parameter may have components along two axes, or three axes,
implying a vector order parameter, with $n=2$ or $n=3$, respectively. It
is clear that the order-parameter $n$-value will be reflected in the
nature of the coarse-grained configurations, and thus in the universal
observables they imply.

A third important feature which can change the universality class of a
critical system is the range of the interaction potential between its
constituent particles. Clearly for the Ising model, interactions between
spins are inherently nearest neighbour in character. Most fluids
interact via dispersion forces (such as the Lennard-Jones potential)
which is also short ranged owing to the $r^{-6}$ attractive interaction.
However some systems have much longer ranged interactions. Notable here
are systems of charged particles which interact via a Coulomb potential.
The long ranged nature of the Coulomb potential (which decays like
$r^{-1}$) means that charged systems often do not have the same critical
exponents as the Ising model and fluid.

## Critical exponents

We consider now how the critical exponents, may be computed via the
coarse-graining procedure. In what follows we will refer only to the
behaviour of a single typical coarse grained variable, which we shall
denote $S(L)$. We suppose that $t$ is sufficiently small that $\xi \gg
L_\textrm{ min}$. Universality and scaling may be expressed in the claim
that, for *any* $L$ and $t$, scale factors $a(L)$ and $b(L)$ may be
found such that the probability distribution $p(S(L),t)$ can be written
in the form

$$p(S(L),t)=b(L)\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)
\label{eq:blocks}$$ where $\tilde{p}$ is a function unique to a
universality class. The role of the scale factors $a$ and $b$ is to
absorb the basic non-universal scales identified in
sec. [9.2](#sec:rgmethod){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:rgmethod"}. The critical exponents are implicit in the
$L$-dependence of these scale factors. Specifically one finds:

\begin{aligned}
a(L)&=&a_0L^{1/\nu} \\
b(L)&=&b_0L^{\beta/\nu}
\label{eq:scalefacs}
\end{aligned} where the amplitudes $a_0$ and $b_0$ are system specific
(non-universal) constants.

These results state that the critical exponents (in the form $1/\nu$ and
$\beta/\nu$) characterize the ways in which the configuration spectrum
evolves under coarse-graining. Consider, first the exponent ratio
$\beta/\nu$. Precisely at the critical point, there is only one way in
which the coarse-grained configurations change with $L$: the overall
scale of the coarse-grained variable (the black-white contrast in our
grey scale representation) is eroded with increasing $L$. Thus the
configurations of coarse-graining length $L_1$ match those of a larger
coarse-graining length $L_2$ only if the variable scale in the latter
configurations is amplified. The required amplification follows from
eqns. [\[eq:blocks\]](#eq:blocks){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:blocks"}
and [\[eq:scalefacs\]](#eq:scalefacs){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:scalefacs"}: it is

$$\frac{b(L_2)}{b(L_1)}=\left(\frac{L_2}{L_1}\right)^{\beta/\nu}\:.$$
The exponent ratio $\beta/\nu$ thus controls the rate at which the scale
of the ordering variable decays with increasing coarse-graining length.

Consider now the exponent $1/\nu$. For small but non-zero reduced
temperature (large but finite $\xi$) there is second way in which the
configuration spectrum evolves with $L$. As noted previously, coarse
graining reduces the ratio of correlation length to coarse-graining
length, and results in configurations with a less critical appearance.
More precisely, we see from
eq. [\[eq:blocks\]](#eq:blocks){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:blocks"} that increasing the coarse graining length from
$L_1$ to $L_2$ while keeping the reduced temperature constant has the
same effect on the configuration spectrum as keeping coarse-graining
length constant which amplifying the reduced temperature $t$ by a factor

$$\frac{a(L_2)}{a(L_1)}=\left(\frac{L_2}{L_1}\right)^{1/\nu}\:.$$ One
may think of the combination $a(L)t$ as a measure of the effective
reduced temperature of the physical system viewed with resolution length
$L$. The exponent $1/\nu$ controls the rate at which the effective
reduced temperature flows with increasing coarse-graining length.

## Finite-size scaling {#sec-fss}

We can exploit the fact that the scale factors $a(L)$ and $b(L)$ depend
on critical exponents to estimate the values of these exponents using
computer simulation. Consider the average of the block variable $S(L)$.
Consideration of eq. [\[eq:blkvar\]](#eq:blkvar){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:blkvar"} shows that this is non other than the value of
the order parameter $Q$, measured over a block of side $L$. Thus from
the definition of an average

$$Q(L,t)=\bar {S}(L,t)=\int S(L)p(S(L),t)dS(L)$$ where $p(S(L))$ is the
probability distribution of $S(L)$.

Making use of the representation of
eq. [\[eq:blocks\]](#eq:blocks){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:blocks"}, we then have that

$$Q(L,t) = \int b(L)S(L)\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)dS(L)$$

To integrate this we need to change the integration variable from $S(L)$
to $b(L)S(L)$. We have $d(b(L)S(L))=b(L)dS(L)$ since $b(L)$ does not
fluctuate. Thus

\begin{aligned}
Q(L,t) =& b^{-1}(L)\int b(L)S(L)\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)d(b(L)S(L))\nonumber\\
       =& b^{-1}(L)f(a(L)t)\nonumber\\
       =& b_0L^{-\beta/\nu}f(a_0L^{1/\nu}t)
\end{aligned} where $f$ is a universal function (defined as the first
moment of $\tilde{p}(x,y)$ with respect to $y$).

The above results provide a method for determining the critical exponent
ratios $\beta/\nu$ and $1/\nu$ via computer simulations of near critical
systems. For instance, at the critical point ($t=0$) and for finite
block size, $Q(L,0)$ will not be zero (the $T$ at which Q vanishes for
finite $L$ is above the true $T_c$, cf.
sec [8.2](#sec:compsim){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:compsim"}).
However, we know that its value must vanish in the limit of infinite
$L$; it does so like

$$Q(L,0)=b_0L^{-\beta/\nu}f(0)\equiv Q_0L^{-\beta/\nu}$$

Thus by studying the critical point $L$ dependence of $Q$ we can
estimate $\beta/\nu$. A similar approach in which we study two block
sizes $L$, and tune $t$ separately in each case so that the results for
$QL^{\beta/\nu}$ are identical provides information on the value of
$1/\nu$.


## Summary of main points
As this is quite a long chapter let us summarise the main points: 


- **Limitations of conventional theories**: Mean field theories and the scaling hypothesis are insufficient in the critical region due to their neglect of correlations across all relevant length scales.

- **Critical region characteristics**: Near-critical systems exhibit correlated microstructure on all length scales up to the correlation length. The complexity of this structure makes both analytical and computational study challenging.

- **Relevant length scales**:
  1. Correlation length ($\xi$)
  2. Minimum microscopic scale ($L_\textrm{min}$)
  3. Macroscopic system size ($L_\textrm{max}$)

- **Window Condition for criticality**: The true critical regime satisfies $L_\textrm{max} \gg \xi \gg L_\textrm{min}$, encompassing a broad range of scales where complex, often fractal-like, structures are present.

- **Renormalisation Group (RG) methodology**: RG involves the stepwise elimination of degrees of freedom by coarse-graining the system over increasing length scales. A fourth scale, $L$, represents the resolution at which the system is described.

- **Effect of coarse-graining**: Coarse-graining changes the effective reduced temperature, captured by the relation $a(L)t$, where $a(L)$ scales with $L$ as $L^{1/\nu}$. This helps describe how critical configurations evolve with resolution.

- **Universality**:
  - Coarse-graining reveals that microscopically different systems can exhibit identical critical behavior when observed at large scales.
  - The concept of **universality** explains why disparate systems, such as magnets and fluids, can show the same critical exponents and scaling laws.
  - Critical behavior depends primarily on general features like dimensionality and symmetry, rather than microscopic details.


- **Finite-Size scaling**:
  - The average block variable $Q(L,t)$ is related to block size $L$ and reduced temperature $t$ through scaling relations. Computer simulations exploit this to extract scaling functions and the values of critical exponents.
