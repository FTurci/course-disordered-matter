title: "Entropy matters"
---

Most of the matter around us does not simply fit within the idealised pictures of crystallines solids or simple liquids: examples include colloids, polymers, surfactants, liquid crystals, foams, gels, and biological materials such as proteins, DNA, and cell membranes. 

This means that cellular **life itself **(the very constituents that make us) obeys to principles that go beyond the standard patters of conventional solid-state physics.


This branch of physics is called **soft condensed matter physics**, or **macromolecular** physics, or the physics of **complex fluids**.

While we often think about problems in physics as a matter of energy minimisation, in soft-matter physics a key role is played by the **fluctuations**. Typically (but not exclusively) these are **thermal fluctuations**. This means that if

# The Physics of Entropy

Soft matter physics is fundamentally the physics of **entropy**. Unlike traditional systems where energy minimization dominates, in soft matter, entropy plays a crucial role in determining the structure, dynamics, and behavior of the system. The interplay between entropy and energy leads to the rich and diverse phenomena observed in soft matter systems.

All these systems contain structural units in the colloidal length scale, $1 \mathrm{~nm} \lesssim \mathrm{R} \lesssim 1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$.

### Systems and definitions

-   A colloid consists of a disperse phase (solid, liquid or gas 'particles') distributed in a finely divided state in a dispersion medium (solid, liquid or gas 'solvent').

| disp. phase Â disp. medium | solid | liquid | gas |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **solid** | **solid suspension**: *pigmented plastics, stained glass, ruby glass, opal, pearl* | **sol, coll. susp.**: *metal sol, toothpaste, paint, ink, clay slurries, mud* | **solid aerosol**: *smoke, dust* |
| **liquid** | **solid emulsion**: *bituminous road paving, ice cream* | **emulsion**: *milk, mayonnaise, butter, pharmaceutical creams, digestion* | **liquid aerosol**: *fog, mist, tobacco smoke, hair spray* |
| **gas** | **solid foam**: *zeolites, expanded polystyrene, 'silica gel'* | **foam**: *froths, soap foam, fire-extinguisher* | \- |

-   A **polymer** is a large molecule made up of many (hundreds to millions) repeats of a single subunit ('monomer'). It is kept together by covalent chemical bonds. Different architectures exist: linear-chain homopolymers, (block) copolymers, starpolymers, dendrimers etc. We concentrate on linear chains, which also represents the main building block of the other structures. Examples: polyethylene, cellulose, DNA, proteins. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-04.jpg?height=415&width=329&top_left_y=232&top_left_x=235){width="212"} ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-04.jpg?height=421&width=332&top_left_y=229&top_left_x=656)
-   A **surfactant** (SURFace ACTive AgeNT) is a special kind of molecule. In the simplest case, it has a water-loving (hydrophilic) 'head group', and a water-hating (hydrophobic) 'tail'. Above a certain concentration they spontaneously selfassemble into a wide variety of structures, the simplest being a spherical micelle. They associate by (rather weak) physical interactions ('association colloids'). Examples: ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-04.jpg?height=426&width=752&top_left_y=1009&top_left_x=1086){width="334"} Sodium Dodecylsulfate (SDS), lipids.

Note: In general, when in bulk form, the substance forming colloidal particles is quite insoluble in the dispersion medium. However, when the bulk material is broken down into very small pieces it can be dispersed. Such a system is called a lyophobic ('solvent-avoiding') colloid. Some colloidal particles themselves consist of polymers or surfactant assemblies which can easily be dispersed and are thus labelled lyophilic ('solvent-loving'). Mostly when we talk about "colloids", we do not care about the 'internal' structure of the particles, while we are in general interested in the structure of polymers or surfactant assemblies.

-   Many liquid-state soft matter system, particular colloids and polymers can be cooled to very low temperatures without crystallizing. At these low temperatures, the typical relaxation times of the particles becomes very high, even on experimental time scales. Thus the liquid-like disorder is "frozen-in" and we refer to the system as a glass.

### Macromolecules: principal distinguishing features

#### Size Range ( $1 \mathrm{~nm} \lesssim R \lesssim 1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ )

Lower limit (about 1 nm ): This ensures that the size of the dispersed particles is much larger than the size of the molecules forming the dispersion medium. This not only distinguishes colloids from ordinary (true) solutions, but also results in a 'welldefined' interface between the particles and the surrounding medium. Furthermore, (most of the time) this allows us both, to treat the dispersion medium as a continuum and to avoid quantum mechanics.

#### Upper limit (about $1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ):

-   Balance of thermal and potential energy:

Every particle has thermal energy $\mathrm{E}_{\text {therm }}=(3 / 2) k_{B} T$ and potential energy $E_{\mathrm{pot}}=m g z=(4 \pi / 3) R^{3} \Delta \rho g z$, where $z$ is a characteristic length, e.g. $R$, and $\Delta \rho$ is the density difference between the particle and the dispersion medium. For a significant influence of the thermal energy we need $E_{\mathrm{pot}}<E_{\text {therm }}$ and thus for a typical system $\left(\Delta \rho \approx 0.3 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\right): \quad R<\left(9 k_{B} T / 8 \pi \Delta \rho g\right)^{1 / 4} \approx 1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$.

##### Sedimentation:

Gravity will lead to sedimentation of the suspended particles (or creaming, if the density of the particles is lower than the density of the dispersion medium) and to the formation of a dense sediment.

The sedimentation velocity $v_{\text {sed }}$ results from the balance of gravity and hydrodynamic drag:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \quad \text { gravity: } \\
F_{g}= & m_{\text {part }} g-m_{\text {liq }} g \\
= & V\left(\rho_{\text {part }}-\rho_{\text {liq }}\right) g \\
& =V \Delta \rho g \\
\downarrow & \text { sphere } \\
& F_{g}=\frac{4 \pi}{3} R^{3} \Delta \rho g
\end{aligned}
$$

friction (Stokes law): where $m$ is the mass and $\rho$ the density of the particle (part) and liquid (liq), respectively, $\Delta \rho$ the density difference, $V$ the volume and $R$ the radius of the particle, $\eta$ the viscosity, $v$ the sedimentation velocity and $g$ the acceleration due to gravity.

### Brownian motion and random walks

Random collisions with the liquid molecules cause the particle to change its direction of motion rapidly (resulting in 'mixing' the sample). This can be modelled as a random (drunk!) walk of $N$ steps of length $b$ with a random angle between the individual steps. How far from the origin does the particle get in N steps? ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-06.jpg?height=415&width=313&top_left_y=882&top_left_x=868)

Average over many tries (or many particles):

$$
\left\langle\underline{R}>=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\left\langle\underline{r}_{j}\right\rangle=0 \quad \text { since } \underline{r}_{j}\right. \text { can be in any direction }
$$

Mean square displacement:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&<\underline{R}^{2}>=<\underline{R} \cdot \underline{R}>=<\sum_{j=1}^{N} \underline{r}_{j} \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{N} \underline{r}_{k}>=\sum_{j=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N}\left\langle\underline{r}_{j} \cdot \underline{r}_{k}>\right. \\
& j=k:<\underline{r}_{j} \cdot \underline{r}_{k}>=\left\langle\underline{r}_{j}^{2}>=b^{2}\right. \\
& j \neq k:<\underline{r}_{j} \cdot \underline{r}_{k}>=b^{2}<\cos \theta>=0 \quad \text { since any } \theta \text { in } 0 \leqq \theta \leqq 2 \pi \\
&<\underline{R}^{2}>=\sum_{j=1}^{N} b^{2}=N b^{2} \propto t \quad \text { since time } t \propto N
\end{aligned}
$$

In fact a more careful treatment shows that the root mean-square displacement $<\underline{R}^{2}>1 / 2$ $=\sqrt{2 D t} \propto \sqrt{t}$ where for spherical particles the diffusion constant $D=k_{B} T / 6 \pi \eta R$, where $R$ is the particle radius.

Example: Consider uncharged protein spheres in water ( $\rho$ protein $=1.35 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ ) at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(\eta$ $=1 \mathrm{Ps})$. We can calculate the displacement due to Brownian motion and sedimentation respectively as a function of the particle radius $R$.

For Brownian motion, we have $\left\langle\underline{R}^{2}\right\rangle^{1 / 2}=\sqrt{2 D t}$ with $D=k_{B} T / 6 \pi \eta R$ For sedimentation, we have $v_{\text {sed }}=2 R^{2} \Delta \rho g / 9 \eta$ Hence we can make a plot of displacement versus particle radius.

| R | $\mathrm{D}\left(20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ | $\left(\left\langle\underline{R}^{2}\right\rangle\right)^{1 / 2}$ after 1 h |   | $\mathrm{v}_{\text {sed }} \times 1 \mathrm{~h}$ |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| 1 nm | $2.1 \cdot 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$ | $1230 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ | $>$ | 2.8 nm |
| 10 nm | $2.1 \cdot 10^{-11} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$ | $390 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ | $>$ | $0.3 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ |
| 100 nm | $2.1 \cdot 10^{-12} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$ | $123 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ | $>$ | $30 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ |
| $1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ | $2.1 \cdot 10^{-13} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$ | $39 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ | $<$ | 3 mm |
| $10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ | $2.1 \cdot 10^{-14} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$ | $12 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ | $<$ | 0.3 m |

More generally we can write down equations which express the probability of finding a particle at a given vector displacement from its starting point. In the limit of a large number of random steps, one finds that in 1 dimension this probability is given by

$$
P_{N}(x) d x=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi<(\Delta x)^{2}>}} e^{-\frac{(x-\langle x\rangle)^{2}}{\left.2<(\Delta x)^{2}\right\rangle}} d x \quad \text { A 1d Gaussian distribution }
$$

This has mean $\langle x\rangle=0$ and variance $\left\langle(\Delta x)^{2}\right\rangle \equiv \sigma^{2}>0$.

In 3 dimensions, the corresponding relation is

$$
P(\underline{r}) d \underline{r}=\frac{1}{\left(2 \pi \sigma^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}} e^{-r^{2} / 2 \sigma^{2}} d \underline{r}
$$

The distribution has its first moment at the origin and second moment

$$
\left\langle\underline{r}^{2}\right\rangle=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \underline{r}^{2} P(\underline{r}) d \underline{r}=\frac{1}{\left(2 \pi \sigma^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}} \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin \theta d \theta \int_{0}^{2 \pi} d \phi \int_{0}^{\infty} r^{4} e^{-r^{2} / 2 \sigma^{2}} d r=3 \sigma^{2}
$$

This latter result can also be obtained in a direct calculation, considering $N$ random steps in x direction, $N$ in y direction and $N$ in z direction with $\left\langle x^{2}\right\rangle=\left\langle y^{2}\right\rangle=\left\langle z^{2}\right\rangle=\sigma^{2}$ and thus $\left\langle\underline{r}^{2}\right\rangle=\left\langle x^{2}\right\rangle+\left\langle y^{2}\right\rangle+\left\langle z^{2}\right\rangle=3 \sigma^{2}=N b^{2}$

### Large interface between dispersed phase and dispersion medium

In commercial terms it is often highly desirable to produce soft matter systems whose (chemical) properties lie somewhere between those of bulk and molecularly dispersed systems, i.e. whose properties are not just the sum of the contributions from the molecules in the bulk phases. To achieve this, a significant proportion of the molecules should lie within or close to the particle-medium interface, which is equivalent to a large surface-to-volume ratio ('microheterogeneous' systems, link to surface science). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-09.jpg?height=903&width=1063&top_left_y=321&top_left_x=496)

Often colloidal particles have a spherical shape, which allows for a relatively small surface-to-volume ratio, but they may also be ellipsoids (prolate or oblate), discs, rods, fibres, random coils etc.

### Making measurements: Scattering experiments

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-09.jpg?height=456&width=1318&top_left_y=1710&top_left_x=238)

The most commonly used experimental tool for studying soft matter systems is scattering. The experiment may utilize light, neutrons or X-rays as the scattering probe. Due to the random arrangement of particles, a random diffraction pattern is observed. This fluctuates as particles move in Brownian motion. The scattered intensity as measured under a certain scattering angle will thus also fluctuate with time (given the detector area is small enough).
