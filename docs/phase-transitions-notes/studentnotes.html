<p>One motivation for supplying you with detailed printed notes for this course is the absence of a wholly ideal text book. However, it should be stressed that while these notes approach (in places) the detail of a book, the notes are not fully comprehensive and should be regarded as the ‘bare bones’ of the course, to be fleshed out via your own reading and supplementary note taking. To this end perhaps the most appropriate textbook is</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A wide variety of physical systems undergo rearrangements of their internal constituents in response to the thermodynamic conditions to which they are subject. Two classic examples of systems displaying such phase transitions are the ferromagnet and fluid systems. As the temperature of a ferromagnet is increased, its magnetic moment is observed to decrease smoothly, until at a certain temperature known as the critical temperature, it vanishes altogether.</p>
<figure id="fig:isingpd" class="figure">

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Similarly, a change of state from liquid to gas can be induced in a fluid system (though not in an ideal gas) simply by raising the temperature. Typically the liquid-vapour transition is abrupt, reflecting the large density difference between the states either side of the transition. However the abruptness of this transition can be reduced by applying pressure. At one particular pressure and temperature the discontinuity in the density difference between the two states vanishes. These conditions of pressure and temperature serve to locate the critical point for the fluid.</p>

</figure>
<p>In the vicinity of a critical point a system will exhibit a variety of remarkable effects known collectively as critical phenomena. Principal among these effects is the divergence of thermal response functions such as the specific heat and the fluid compressibility or magnetic susceptibility. It transpires that the origin of the singularities in these quantities can be traced to large-length-scale co-operative effects between the microscopic constituents of the system. The recalcitrant problem posed by the critical region is how best to incorporate such collective effects within the framework of a rigorous mathematical theory that affords both physical insight and quantitative explanation of the observed phenomena. This matter has been (and still is!) the subject of intense theoretical activity.</p>
<p>The importance of the critical point stems largely from the fact that many of the phenomena observed in its vicinity are believed to be common to a whole range of apparently quite disparate physical systems. Systems such as liquid mixtures, superconductors, liquid crystals, ferromagnets, antiferromagnets and molecular crystals may display identical behaviour near criticality. This observation implies a profound underlying similarity among physical systems at criticality, regardless of many aspects of their distinctive microscopic nature. These ideas have found formal expression in the so-called ‘universality hypothesis’ which, since its inception some 35 years ago, has enjoyed considerable success.</p>
<p>In this course, principal aspects of the contemporary theoretical viewpoint of phase transitions and critical phenomena will be reviewed. Mean field theories of phase transitions will be discussed and their inadequacies in the critical region will be exposed. The phenomenology of the critical region will we described including power laws, critical exponents and their relationship to scaling phenomena. These will be set within the context of the powerful renormalisation group technique. The notion of universality as a phenomenological hypothesis will be introduced and its implications for real and model systems will be explored. Finally, the utility of finite-size scaling methods for computer studies of critical phenomena will be discussed, culminating in the introduction of a specific technique suitable for exposing universality in model systems.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec:background" class="level1">
<h1>Background concepts</h1>
<p>In seeking to describe near-critical phenomena, it is useful to have a quantitative measure of the difference between the phases coalescing at the critical point: this is the role of the <em>order parameter</em>, <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. In the case of the fluid, the order parameter is taken as the difference between the densities of the liquid and vapour phases. In the ferromagnet it is taken as the magnetisation. As its name suggest, the order parameter serves as a measure of the kind of orderliness that sets in when the temperature is cooled below a critical temperature.</p>
<p>Our first task is to give some feeling for the principles which underlie the ordering process. The probability <span class="math inline">\(p_a\)</span> that a physical system at temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> will have a particular microscopic arrangement (configuration), labelled <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, of energy <span class="math inline">\(E_a\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p_a=\frac{1}{Z}e^{-E_a/k_BT}
\label{eq:probs}\]</span></p>
<p>The prefactor <span class="math inline">\(Z^{-1}\)</span> is the <em>partition function</em>: since the system must always have <em>some</em> specific arrangement, the sum of the probabilities <span class="math inline">\(p_a\)</span> must be unity, implying that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z=\sum_ae^{-E_a/k_BT}
\label{eq:partition}\]</span> where the sum extends over all possible microscopic arrangements.</p>
<p>These equations assume that physical system evolves rapidly (on the timescale of typical observations) amongst all its allowed arrangements, sampling them with the probabilities eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:probs" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:probs">[eq:probs]</a>; the expectation value of any physical observable <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> will thus be given by averaging <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> over all the arrangements <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, weighting each contribution by the appropriate probability:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar {O}=\frac{1}{Z}\sum_a O_a e^{-E_a/k_BT}
\label{eq:observable}\]</span></p>
<p>Sums like eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:observable" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:observable">[eq:observable]</a> are not easily evaluated. Nevertheless, some important insights follow painlessly. Consider the case where the observable of interest is the order parameter, or more specifically the magnetisation of a ferromagnet.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q=\frac{1}{Z}\sum_a Q_a e^{-E_a/k_BT}
\label{eq:op}\]</span></p>
<p>It is clear from eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:probs" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:probs">[eq:probs]</a> that at very low temperature the system will be overwhelmingly likely to be found in its minimum energy arrangements (ground states). For the ferromagnet, these are the fully ordered spin arrangements having magnetisation <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now consider the high temperature limit. The enhanced weight that the fully ordered arrangement carries in the sum of eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:op" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:op">[eq:op]</a> by virtue of its low energy, is now no longer sufficient to offset the fact that arrangements in which <span class="math inline">\(Q_a\)</span> has some intermediate value, though each carry a smaller weight, are vastly greater in number. A little thought shows that the arrangements which have essentially zero magnetisation (equal populations of up and down spins) are by far the most numerous. At high temperature, these disordered arrangements dominate the sum in eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:op" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:op">[eq:op]</a> and the order parameter is zero.</p>
<p>The competition between energy-of-arrangements weighting (or simply ‘energy’) and the ‘number of arrangements’ weighting (or ‘entropy’) is then the key principle at work here. The distinctive feature of a system with a critical point is that, in the course of this competition, the system is forced to choose amongst a number of macroscopically different sets of microscopic arrangements.</p>
<p>Finally in this section, we note that the probabilistic (statistical mechanics) approach to thermal systems outlined above is completely compatible with classical thermodynamics. Specifically, the bridge between the two disciplines is provided by the following equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F=-k_BT \ln Z
\label{eq:free}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is the “Helmholtz free energy”. All thermodynamic observables, for example the order parameter <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, and response functions such as the specific heat or magnetic susceptibility are obtainable as appropriate derivatives of the free energy. For instance, utilizing eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:partition" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:partition">[eq:partition]</a>, one can readily verify (try it as an exercise!) that the average internal energy is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar{E}=-\frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\beta=(k_BT)^{-1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The relationship between other thermodynamic quantities and derivatives of the free energy are given in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:thermo" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:thermo">3</a></p>

<h1>The Approach to Criticality</h1>
<p>It is a matter of experimental fact that the approach to criticality in a given system is characterized by the divergence of various thermodynamic observables. Let us remain with the archetypal example of a critical system, the ferromagnet, whose critical temperature will be denoted as <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>. For temperatures close to <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>, the magnetic response functions (the magnetic susceptibility <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> and the specific heat) are found to be singular functions, diverging as a <em>power</em> of the reduced (dimensionless) temperature <span class="math inline">\(t \equiv

<p>Another key quantity is the correlation length <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>, which measures the distance over which fluctuations of the magnetic moments are correlated. This is observed to diverge near the critical point with an exponent <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>.</p>

<p>Similar power law behaviour is found for the order parameter <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> (in this case the magnetisation) which vanishes in a singular fashion (it has infinite gradient) as the critical point is is approached as a function of temperature:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m \propto t^{\beta} ~~~~ (T &lt; T_c,\: H=0) \label{eq:mag},\]</span> (here the symbol <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, is not to be confused with <span class="math inline">\(\beta=1/k_BT\)</span>– this unfortunately is the standard notation.)</p>

<p>The quantities <span class="math inline">\(\gamma, \alpha, \nu, \beta\)</span> in the above equations are known as critical exponents. They serve to control the rate at which the various thermodynamic quantities change on the approach to criticality.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the form of singular behaviour observed at criticality for the example ferromagnet also occurs in qualitatively quite different systems such as the fluid. All that is required to obtain the corresponding power law relationships for the fluid is to substitute the analogous thermodynamic quantities in to the above equations. Accordingly the magnetisation order parameter is replaced by the density difference <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{liq}-\rho_{gas}\)</span> while the susceptibility is replaced by the isothermal compressibility and the specific heat capacity at constant field is replaced by the specific heat capacity at constant volume. The approach to criticality in a variety of qualitatively quite different systems can therefore be expressed in terms of a set of critical exponents describing the power law behaviour for that system (see the book by Yeomans for examples).</p>
<p>Even more remarkable is the experimental observation that the values of the critical exponents for a whole range of fluids and magnets (and indeed many other systems with critical points) are <em>identical</em>. This is the phenomenon of <em>universality</em>. It implies a deep underlying physical similarity between ostensibly disparate critical systems. The principal aim of theories of critical point phenomena is to provide a sound theoretical basis for the existence of power law behaviour, the factors governing the observed values of critical exponents and the universality phenomenon. Ultimately this basis is provided by the Renormalisation Group (RG) theory, for which K.G. Wilson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1982.</p>

<h1>The Ising model: the prototype model for a phase transition</h1>
<p>In order to probe the properties of the critical region, it is common to appeal to simplified model systems whose behaviour parallels that of real materials. The sophistication of any particular model depends on the properties of the system it is supposed to represent. The simplest model to exhibit critical phenomena is the two-dimensional Ising model of a ferromagnet. Actual physical realizations of 2-d magnetic systems do exist in the form of layered ferromagnets such as K<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>CoF<span class="math inline">\(_4\)</span>, so the 2-d Ising model is of more than just technical relevance.</p>

<p>The 2-d spin-<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> Ising model envisages a regular arrangement of magnetic moments or ‘spins’ on an infinite plane. Each spin can take two values, <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> (‘up’ spins) or <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> (‘down’ spins) and is assumed to interact with its nearest neighbours according to the Hamiltonian</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\cal H}_I=-J\sum_{&lt;ij&gt;}s_is_j - H\sum_i s_i
\label{eq:ising}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(J&gt;0\)</span> measures the strength of the coupling between spins and the sum extends over nearest neighbour spins <span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_j\)</span>, i.e it is a sum of the bonds of the lattice. <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is a magnetic field term which can be positive or negative (although for the time being we will set it equal to zero). The order parameter is simply the average magnetisation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m=\frac{1}{N} \langle \sum_i s_i \rangle\:,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\langle\cdot\rangle\)</span> means an average over configurations.</p>
<p>The fact that the Ising model displays a phase transition was argued in sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:background" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:background">2</a>. Thus at low temperatures for which there is little thermal disorder, there is a preponderance of aligned spins and hence a net spontaneous magnetic moment (ie. the system is ferromagnetic). As the temperature is raised, thermal disorder increases until at a certain temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>, entropy drives the system through a continuous phase transition to a disordered spin arrangement with zero net magnetisation (ie. the system is paramagnetic). These trends are visible in configurational snapshots from computer simulations of the 2D Ising model (see fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:snapshots" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:snapshots">5</a>). Although each spin interacts only with its nearest neighbours, the phase transition occurs due to cooperative effects among a large number of spins. In the neighbourhood of the transition temperature these cooperative effects engender fluctuations that can extend over all length-scales from the lattice spacing up to the correlation length.</p>

http://www.pha.jhu.edu/&nbsp;javalab/ising/ising.html (accessible via the Moodle page). By altering the temperature you will be able to observe for yourself how the spin arrangements change as one traverses the critical region. Pay particular attention to the configurations near the critical point. They have very interesting properties. We will return to them later!</p>
<p>Although the 2-d Ising model may appear at first sight to be an excessively simplistic portrayal of a real magnetic system, critical point universality implies that many physical observables such as critical exponents are not materially influenced by the actual nature of the microscopic interactions. The Ising model therefore provides a simple, yet <em>quantitatively</em> accurate representation of the critical properties of a whole range of real magnetic (and indeed fluid) systems. This universal feature of the model is largely responsible for its ubiquity in the field of critical phenomena. We shall explore these ideas in more detail later in the course.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exact-solutions-the-one-dimensional-ising-chain">Exact solutions: the one dimensional Ising chain</h2>
<p>One might well ask why the 2D Ising model is the simplest model to exhibit a phase transition. What about the one-dimensional Ising model (ie. spins on a line)? In fact in one dimension, the Ising model can be solved exactly. It turns out that the system is paramagnetic for all <span class="math inline">\(T&gt;0\)</span>, so there is no phase transition at any finite temperature. To see this, consider the ground state of the system in zero external field. This will have all spins aligned the same way (say up), and hence be ferromagnetic. Now consider a configuration with a various “domain walls” dividing spin up and spin down regions:</p>
<figure id="fig:chain" class="figure">
<figcaption>
<span><strong>(a)</strong></span> Schematic of an Ising chain at <span class="math inline"><em>T</em> = 0</span>. <span><strong>(b)</strong></span> At a small finite temperature the chain is split into domains of spins ordered in the same direction. Domains are separated by notional domain “walls”, which cost energy <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em> = 2<em>J</em></span>. Periodic boundary conditions are assumed.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Instead of considering the underlying spin configurations, we shall describe the system in terms of the statistics of its domain walls. The energy cost of a wall is <span class="math inline">\(\Delta = 2J\)</span>, independent of position. Domain walls can occupy the bonds of the lattice, of which there are <span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span>. Moreover, the walls are noninteracting, except that you cannot have two of them on the same bond. (Check through these ideas if you are unsure.)</p>
<p>In this representation, the partition function involves a count over all possible domain wall arrangements. Since the domain walls are non interacting (eg it doesn’t cost energy for one to move along the chain) we can calculate <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> by considering the partition function associated with a single domain wall being present or absent on some given bond, and then simply raise to the power of the number of bonds:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z=Z_1^{N-1}\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z_1=e^{\beta J} + e^{\beta (J-\Delta)}=e^{\beta J}(1+e^{-\beta\Delta})\]</span> is the domain wall partition function for a single bond and represent the sum over the two possible states: domain wall absent or present. Then the free energy per bond of the system is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\beta f\equiv \beta F/(N-1)=-\ln Z_1=-\beta J-\ln(1+e^{-\beta\Delta})\]</span></p>
<p>The first term on the RHS is simply the energy per spin of the ferromagnetic (ordered) phase, while the second term arises from the free energy of domain walls. Clearly for any finite temperature (ie. for <span class="math inline">\(\beta&lt;\infty\)</span>), this second term is finite and negative. Hence the free energy will always be lowered by having a finite concentration of domain walls in the system. Since these domain walls disorder the system, leading to a zero average magnetisation, the 1D system is paramagnetic for all finite temperatures. <em>Exercise</em>: Explain why this argument works only in 1D.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="more-general-1d-spins-systems-transfer-matrix-method">More general 1D spins systems: transfer matrix method</h3>
<p>Generally speaking one-dimensional systems lend themselves to a degree of analytic tractability not found in most higher dimensional models. Indeed for the case of a 1-d assembly of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> spins each having <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> discrete energy states, and in the presence of a magnetic field, it is possible to reduce the evaluation of the partition function to the calculation of the eigenvalues of a matrix–the so called transfer matrix.</p>
<p>Let us start by assuming that the assembly has cyclic boundary conditions, then the total energy of configuration <span class="math inline">\(\{s\}\)</span> is</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
H(\{s\})=&amp;-\sum_{i=1}^N (Js_is_{i+1}+Hs_i)\\
\:=&amp;-\sum_{i=1}^N (Js_is_{i+1}+H(s_i+s_{i+1})/2)\\
\:=&amp;\sum_{i=1}^N E(s_i,s_{i+1})
\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>where we have defined <span class="math inline">\(E(s_i,s_{i+1})=-Js_is_{i+1}-H(s_i+s_{i+1})/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now the partition function may be written</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:tm}
Z_N =&amp; \sum_{\{s\}}\exp\left(-\beta H(\{s\})\right)\nonumber \\
=&amp;\sum_{\{s\}}\exp\left(-\beta[E(s_1,s_2)+E(s_2,s_3)+....E(s_N,s_1)]\right) \nonumber\\
=&amp;\sum_{\{s\}}\exp\left(-\beta E(s_1,s_2)\right)\exp\left(-\beta E(s_2,s_3)\right)....\exp\left(-\beta E(s_N,s_1)\right) \nonumber\\
=&amp;\sum_{i,j,...,l=1}^m V_{ij}V_{jk}...V_{li} \label{eq:Vs}
\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>where the <span class="math inline">\(V_{ij}=\exp(-\beta E_{ij})\)</span> are elements of an <span class="math inline">\(m \times m\)</span> matrix <span class="math inline">\({\bf V}\)</span>, known as the transfer matrix (<span class="math inline">\(i,j,k\)</span> etc are dummy indices that run over the matrix elements). You should see that the sum over the product of matrix elements picks up all the terms in the partition function and therefore Eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:Vs" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:Vs">[eq:Vs]</a> is an alternative way of writing the partition function.</p>
<p>The reason it is useful to transform to a matrix representation is that it transpires that the sum over the product of matrix elements in equation&nbsp;(<a href="#eq:Vs" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:Vs">[eq:Vs]</a>) is simply just the trace of <span class="math inline">\({\bf V}^N\)</span> (check this yourself for a short periodic chain), given by the sum of its eigenvalues:-</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z_N=\lambda_1^N+\lambda_2^N+...\lambda_m^N\]</span> For very large <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, this expression simplifies further because the largest eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_1\)</span> dominates the behaviour since <span class="math inline">\((\lambda_2/\lambda_1)^N\)</span> vanishes as <span class="math inline">\(N\rightarrow \infty\)</span>. Consequently in the thermodynamic limit one may put <span class="math inline">\(Z_N=\lambda_1^N\)</span> and the problem reduces to identifying the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix.</p>
<p>Specializing to the case of the simple Ising model in the presence of an applied field <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, the transfer matrix takes the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\bf V}(H)=\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
e^{\beta(J+H)} &amp; e^{-\beta J} \\
e^{-\beta J}   &amp; e^{\beta(J-H)}
\end{array} \right)\]</span></p>
<p>This matrix has two eigenvalues which can be readily calculated in the usual fashion as the roots of the characteristic polynomial <span class="math inline">\(|{\bf V}-\lambda{\bf I}|\)</span>. They are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\lambda_{\pm}=e^{\beta J}\cosh(\beta H) \pm \sqrt{e^{2\beta J}\sinh^2\beta H+e^{-2\beta J}}.\]</span></p>
<p>Hence the free energy per spin <span class="math inline">\(f=-k_BT\ln \lambda_+\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f=-k_BT\ln \left[e^{\beta J}\cosh(\beta H) + \sqrt{e^{2\beta J}\sinh^2\beta H+e^{-2\beta J}}\right].\]</span></p>
<p>The Ising model in 2D can also be solved exactly, as was done by Lars Onsager in 1940. The solution is extremely complicated and is regarded as one of the pinnacles of statistical mechanics. In 3D no exact solution is known.</p>

<h1>Mean field theory and perturbation schemes</h1>
<p>Of the wide variety of models of interest to the critical point theorist, the majority have shown themselves intractable to direct analytic (pen and paper) assault. In a very limited number of instances models have been solved exactly, yielding the phase coexistence parameters, critical exponents and the critical temperature. The 2-d spin-<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> Ising model is certainly the most celebrated such example, its principal critical exponents are found to be <span class="math inline">\(\beta=\frac{1}{8}, \nu=1, \gamma=\frac{7}{4}\)</span>. Its critical temperature is <span class="math inline">\(-2J/\ln(\sqrt{2}-1)\approx 2.269J\)</span>. Unfortunately such solutions rarely afford deep insight to the general framework of criticality although they do act as an invaluable test-bed for new and existing theories.</p>
<p>The inability to solve many models exactly often means that one must resort to approximations. One such approximation scheme is mean field theory.</p>
<section id="sec:mfising" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:mfising">Mean field solution of the Ising model</h2>
<p>Let us look for a mean field expression for the free energy of the Ising model whose Hamiltonian is given in Eq. (<a href="#eq:ising" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:ising">[eq:ising]</a>). Write</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s_i=\langle s_i\rangle+(s_i-\langle s_i\rangle)=m+(s_i-m)=m+\delta s_i\]</span></p>
Then
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}

\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>where in the last line we have used the fact that when for each site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> we perform the sum <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{&lt;i,j&gt;}\)</span> over bonds of a quantity which is independent of <span class="math inline">\(s_j\)</span>, then the result is just the number of bonds per site times that quantity. Since the number of bonds on a lattice of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> sites of coordination <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(Nq/2\)</span> (because each bond is shared between two sites), there are therefore <span class="math inline">\(q/2\)</span> bonds per site.</p>
<p>Now the mean field approximation is to ignore the last term in (<a href="#eq:mfa" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:mfa">[eq:mfa]</a>) giving the configurational energy as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\cal H}_{mf}=-\sum_{i}H_{mf}s_i+NqJm^2/2\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(H_{mf}\equiv qJm+ H\)</span> the “mean field” seen by spin <span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span>. As all the spins are decoupled (independent) in this approximation we can write down the partition function, which follows by taking the partition function for a single spin (by summing the Boltzmann factor for <span class="math inline">\(s_i=\pm 1\)</span>) and raising to the power <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> to find</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z=e^{-\beta qJm^2N/2}[2\cosh(\beta(qJm+H))]^N\]</span></p>
<p>The free energy follows as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F(m)=NJqm^2/2-Nk_BT\ln[2\cosh(\beta (qJm+H)]\:.\]</span></p>
<p>and the magnetisation as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m=-\frac{1}{N}\frac{\partial F}{\partial H}=\tanh(\beta(qJm+H))\]</span></p>
<p>To find <span class="math inline">\(m(H,T)\)</span>, we must numerically solve this last equation self consistently.</p>
<p>Note that we can obtain <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> in a different way. Consider some arbitary spin, <span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span> say.

<p>This mean field analysis reveals what is happening in the Ising model near the critical temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>. Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:freeenergy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:freeenergy">7</a> shows sketches for <span class="math inline">\(\beta F(m)/N\)</span> as a function of temperature, where for simplicity we restrict attention to <span class="math inline">\(H=0\)</span>.

At <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is lowered, there comes a point (<span class="math inline">\(T=T_c=qJ/k_B\)</span>) where the curvature of <span class="math inline">\(F(m)\)</span> at the origin changes sign; precisely at this point</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial m^2}=0.\]</span> At lower temperature, there are instead two minima at nonzero <span class="math inline">\(m=\pm m^\star\)</span>, where the <em>equilibrium magnetisation</em> <span class="math inline">\(m^\star\)</span> is the positive root (calculated explicitly below) of</p>

<p>This is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

This may seem counterintuitive, after all at <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> one should expect perfect ordering, not the large fluctuations that accompany criticality. It turns out that the source of the fluctuations that drive the system critical is zero point motion associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Quantum criticality is a matter of ongoing active research, and open questions concern the nature of the phase diagrams and the relationship to superconductivity. Although the subject goes beyond the scope of this course, there are a couple of accessible articles on the Moodle page if you want to learn more.</p>

<p>We look for a solution where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is small (<span class="math inline">\(\ll 1\)</span>). Expanding the tanh function and replacing <span class="math inline">\(\beta=(k_BT)^{-1}\)</span> yields</p>

<section id="landau-theory" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="landau-theory">Landau theory</h2>
<p>Landau theory is a slightly more general type of mean field theory than that discussed in the previous subsection because it is not based on a particular microscopic model. Its starting point is the Helmholtz free energy, which Landau asserted can be written in terms of a truncated power series expansion of the order parameter. For a ferromagnet this takes the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F(m)=F_0+a_2m^2+a_4m^4
\label{eq:landau}\]</span></p>
<p>Here only the terms compatible with the order parameter symmetry are included in the expansion. On symmetry grounds, the free energy of a ferromagnet should be invariant under a reversal of the sign of the magnetisation. Terms linear and cubic in <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> are not invariant under <span class="math inline">\(m\to -m\)</span>, and so do not feature.</p>
<p>One can understand how the Landau free energy can give rise to a critical point by plotting its form for various values of <span class="math inline">\(a_2\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a_4\)</span> assumed positive (which ensures that the magnetisation remains bounded). This is shown in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:landau" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:landau">11</a></p>
<figure id="fig:landau" class="figure">
<figcaption>
Form of the Landau Free energy for a selection of values of the <span class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub>2</sub></span> parameter.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The situation is qualitatively similar to that discussed in sec&nbsp;<a href="#sec:breaking" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:breaking">5.2</a>. Thermodynamics tells us that the system adopts the state of lowest free energy. Thus from fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:landau" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:landau">11</a>, we see that for <span class="math inline">\(a_2&gt;0\)</span>, the system will have <span class="math inline">\(m=0\)</span>, i.e.&nbsp;will be in the disordered (or paramagnetic) phase. For <span class="math inline">\(a_2&lt;0\)</span>, the minimum in the free energy occurs at a finite value of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, indicating that the ordered (ferromagnetic) phase is the stable one. In fact, the physical (up-down) spin symmetry built into <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> indicates that there are two equivalent stable states at <span class="math inline">\(m=\pm m^\star\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(a_2=0\)</span> corresponds to the critical point which marks the border between the ordered and disordered phases.</p>
<p>Clearly <span class="math inline">\(a_2\)</span> controls the deviation from the critical temperature, and accordingly we may write</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a_2=\tilde{a_2} t\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the reduced temperature.</p>
<p>We can now attempt to calculate critical exponents. Restricting ourselves first to the magnetisation exponent <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">\(m=t^\beta\)</span>, we first find the equilibrium magnetisation, corresponding to the minimum of the Landau free energy:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{dF}{dm}=2\tilde{a_2} tm+4a_4m^3=0
\label{eq:minimize}\]</span></p>
<p>which implies</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m\propto (-t)^{1/2},\]</span> so <span class="math inline">\(\beta=1/2\)</span>, which is again a mean field result.</p>
<p>Likewise we can calculate the effect of a small field <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> if we sit at the critical temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(a_2=0\)</span>, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F(m)=F_0+a_4m^4-Hm\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial F}{\partial m}=0 \Rightarrow m(H,T_c)=\left(\frac{H}{4a_4}\right)^{1/3}\]</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H \sim m^\delta ~~~~~ \delta=3\]</span> which defines a second critical exponent.</p>
<p>Note that at the critical point, a small applied field causes a very big increase in magnetisation; formally, <span class="math inline">\((\partial m/\partial H)_T\)</span> is infinite at <span class="math inline">\(T=T_c\)</span>.</p>
<p>A third critical exponent can be defined from the magnetic susceptibility at zero field</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\chi=\left(\frac{\partial m}{\partial H}\right)_{T,V} \sim |T-T_c|^{-\gamma}\]</span></p>
<p><em>Exercise</em>: Show that the Landau expansion predicts <span class="math inline">\(\gamma=1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally we define a fourth critical exponent via the variation of the heat capacity (per site or per unit volume) <span class="math inline">\(C_H\)</span>, in fixed external field <span class="math inline">\(H=0\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_H \sim |T-T_c|^{-\alpha}\]</span></p>
<p>By convention, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is defined to be positive for systems where there is a <em>divergence</em> of the heat capacity at the critical point (very often the case). The heat capacity can be calculated from</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_H =-T\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial T^2}\]</span></p>
<p>From the minimization over <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> (Eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:minimize" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:minimize">[eq:minimize]</a>, one finds (<em>exercise</em>: check this)</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
F = &amp; 0 ~~~~T&gt;T_c\nonumber\\
F = &amp; -a_2^2/4a_4 ~~~~ T &lt; T_c
\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>Using the fact that <span class="math inline">\(a_2\)</span> varies linearly with <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, we have</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
C_H =&amp; 0 ~~~~ T\to T_c^+\nonumber\\
C_H =&amp; \frac{T\tilde a_2^2}{2a_4} ~~~~ T \to T_c^-\:,
\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>which is actually a step discontinuity in specific heat. Since for positive <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> the heat capacity is divergent, and for negative <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> it is continuous, this behaviour formally corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0\)</span></p>

<p>While mean field theories provide a useful route to understanding qualitatively the phenomenology of phase transitions, in real ferromagnets, as well as in more sophisticated theories, the critical exponents are not the simple fraction and integers found here. This failure of mean field theory to predict the correct exponents is of course traceable to their neglect of correlations. In later sections we shall start to take the first steps to including the effects of long range correlations.</p>

<h1>The Lattice Gas model</h1>
<p>A crude representation of a fluid is the lattice gas model. Here particles can occupy the sites of a hypercubic lattice. The occupancy of a site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is specified by the variable <span class="math inline">\(c_i=1\)</span> (occupied) or <span class="math inline">\(c_i=0\)</span> vacant. The complete list of these occupancies <span class="math inline">\(\{c\}\)</span> specifies a microstate. The average particle number density (fraction of occupied sites) is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[c=L^{-d}\sum_ic_i\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the linear extent of the lattice and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> its dimensionality.</p>
<p>The Hamiltonian of the lattice gas model is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\cal H}_{LG}=-\epsilon\sum_{&lt;i,j&gt;}c_ic_j - \mu\sum_ic_i\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is an attraction energy between a pair of particles on adjacent (nearest neighbouring) sites and <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is a field known as the chemical potential, which couples to the particle density which is assumed to fluctuate around a mean value controlled by the prescribed chemical potential. This representation of the model in which the overall density fluctuates is known as the <em>Grand Canonical ensemble.</em></p>
<section id="mapping-between-ising-model-and-lattice-gas" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mapping-between-ising-model-and-lattice-gas">Mapping between Ising model and lattice gas</h2>
<p>The lattice gas model is interesting because whilst being a plausible model for a fluid, it maps onto the Ising model. This extends the applicability of the Ising model. To expose the mapping we write the grand partition function of the lattice gas:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Xi=\sum_\textrm{ state}\exp-\beta{\cal H}_{LG}=\sum_{\{c\}}\exp\left[\beta \epsilon\sum_{&lt;i,j&gt;}c_ic_j +\beta\mu\sum_ic_i\right]\]</span> where the sum is an unrestricted sum over the occupancies of the lattice sites. We now change variables to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[c_i=(1+s_i)/2; ~~~~ J=\frac{\epsilon}{4} ~~~~
h=\frac{\epsilon q+2\mu}{4}\]</span> Hence</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\cal H}_{LG}={\cal H}_\textrm{ I} + \textrm{ constant}\]</span> Since the last term does not depend on the configuration, it feeds through as an additive constant in the free energy; and since all observables feature as derivatives of the free energy, the constant has no physical implications.</p>

<p>Again there is a line of first order phase transitions terminating at a critical point.

<section id="sec:series" class="level1">
<h1>Series expansion</h1>
<p>For many years prior to the introduction of the renormalisation group method, the bedrock of information about true (i.e.&nbsp;non mean-field) criticality in model systems was provided by series expansion techniques. These methods seek to deduce results for the critical region using known results obtained away from criticality. One simple example is the high-temperature series which expresses the Boltzmann factor in terms of a temperature expansion with <span class="math inline">\(1/T\)</span> assumed small.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\exp(-{\cal H}/k_BT)=1-{\cal H}/k_BT +\frac{1}{2!}({\cal H}/k_BT)^2+.....\]</span></p>
<p>Successively higher terms in this series can be regarded as characterizing correlations over successively larger distances. Known results for the high-temperature fully disordered phase can be applied to permit the (rather laborious) calculation of the partition function <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> using the significant terms in this expansion. This procedure can yield surprisingly accurate numerical results although it is typical that the expansions break down close to the critical point, a failure that can be traced back to the divergent correlation length.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-static-scaling-hypothesis" class="level1">
<h1>The Static Scaling Hypothesis</h1>
<p>Historically, the first step towards properly elucidating near-critical behaviour was taken with the static scaling hypothesis. This is essentially a plausible conjecture concerning the origin of power law behaviour which appears to be consistent with observed phenomena. According to the hypothesis, the basis for power law behaviour (and associated scale invariance or “scaling”) in near-critical systems is expressed in the claim that: in the neighbourhood of a critical point, the basic thermodynamic functions (most notably the free energy) are <em>generalized homogeneous functions</em> of their variables. For such functions one can always deduce a scaling law such that by an appropriate change of scale, the dependence on two variables (e.g.&nbsp;the temperature and applied field) can be reduced to dependence on one new variable. This claim may be warranted by the following general argument.</p>
<p>A function of two variables <span class="math inline">\(g(u,v)\)</span> is called a generalized homogeneous function if it has the property</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g(\lambda^au,\lambda^bv)=\lambda g(u,v)\]</span> <strong>for all <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span></strong>, where the parameters <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> (known as scaling parameters) are constants. An example of such a function is <span class="math inline">\(g(u,v)=u^3+v^2\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a=1/3, b=1/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, the arbitrary scale factor <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> can be redefined without loss of generality as <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^a=u^{-1}\)</span> giving</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g(u,v)=u^{1/a}g(1,\frac{v}{u^{b/a}})\]</span> A corresponding relation is obtained by choosing the rescaling to be <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^b=v^{-1}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\label{eq:sca2}
g(u,v)=v^{1/b}g(\frac{u}{v^{a/b}},1)\]</span></p>
<p>This equation demonstrates that <span class="math inline">\(g(u,v)\)</span> indeed satisfies a simple power law in <span class="math inline">\(\it{one}\)</span> variable, subject to the constraint that <span class="math inline">\(u/v^{a/b}\)</span> is a constant. It should be stressed, however, that such a scaling relation specifies neither the function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> nor the parameters <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, the static scaling hypothesis asserts that in the critical region, the free energy <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a generalized homogeneous function of the (reduced) thermodynamic fields <span class="math inline">\(t=(T-T_c)/T_c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h=(H-H_c)\)</span>. Remaining with the example ferromagnet, the following scaling assumption can then be made:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F(\lambda^a t,\lambda^b h)=\lambda F(t,h) \:.
\label{eq:scagibbs}\]</span></p>
<p>Without loss of generality, we can set <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^a=t^{-1}\)</span>, implying <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=t^{-1/a}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^b=t^{-b/a}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then <span class="math display">\[F(t,h)=t^{1/a}F(1,t^{-b/a}h)\]</span> where our choice of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> ensures that <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> on the rhs is now a function of a single variable <span class="math inline">\(t^{-b/a}h\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, as stated in sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:background" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:background">2</a> the free energy provides the route to all thermodynamic functions of interest. An expression for the magnetisation can be obtained simply by taking the field derivative of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> (cf. fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:thermo" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:thermo">3</a>)</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m(t,h)=-t^{(1-b)/a}m(1,t^{-b/a}h)
\label{eq:magscale}\]</span></p>
<p>In zero applied field <span class="math inline">\(h=0\)</span>, this reduces to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m(t,0)=(-t)^{(1-b)/a}m(1,0)\]</span> where the r.h.s. is a power law in <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Equation&nbsp;(<a href="#eq:mag" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:mag">[eq:mag]</a>) then allows identification of the exponent <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> in terms of the scaling parameters <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\beta=\frac{1-b}{a}\]</span></p>
<p>By taking further appropriate derivatives of the free energy, other relations between scaling parameters and critical exponents may be deduced. Such calculations yield the results <span class="math inline">\(\delta =
b/(1-b)\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(\gamma = (2b-1)/a\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha =(2a-1)/a\)</span> <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Relationships between the critical exponents themselves can be obtained trivially by eliminating the scaling parameters from these equations. The principal results (known as “scaling laws”) are:-</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\alpha+\beta(\delta+1)=2 \\
\alpha+2\beta+\gamma=2
\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>Thus, provided all critical exponents can be expressed in terms of the scaling parameters <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, then only two critical exponents need be specified, for all others to be deduced. Of course these scaling laws are also expected to hold for the appropriate thermodynamic functions of analogous systems such as the liquid-gas critical point.</p>

<p>For some particular magnetic system, one can perform an experiment in which one measures <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> vs <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> for various fixed temperatures. This allows one to draw a set of isotherms, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(m-h\)</span> curves of constant <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. These can be used to demonstrate scaling by plotting the data against the scaling variables <span class="math inline">\(M=t^{-\beta}m(t,h)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}=t^{-\beta\delta}h(t,M)\)</span>. Under this scale transformation, it is found that all isotherms (for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> close to zero) coincide to within experimental error. Reassuringly, similar results are found using the scaled equation of state of simple fluid systems such as He<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> or Xe.</p>

<p>In summary, the static scaling hypothesis is remarkably successful in providing a foundation for the observation of power laws and scaling phenomena. However, it furnishes little or no guidance regarding the role of co-operative phenomena at the critical point. In particular it provides no means for calculating the values of the critical exponents appropriate to given model systems.</p>

<p>In seeking to employ simulation to obtain estimates of bulk critical point properties (such as the location of a critical point and the values of its associated exponents), one is immediately confronted with a difficulty. The problem is that simulations are necessarily restricted to dealing with systems of finite-size and cannot therefore accommodate the truly long ranged fluctuations that characterize the near-critical regime. As a consequence, the critical singularities in <span class="math inline">\(C_v\)</span>, order parameter, etc. appear rounded and shifted in a simulation study. Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:shift" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:shift">14</a> shows a schematic example for the susceptibility of a magnet.</p>

<p>Thus the position of the peak in a response function (such as <span class="math inline">\(C_v\)</span>) measured for a finite-sized system does not provide an accurate estimate of the critical temperature. Although the degree of rounding and shifting reduces with system size, it is often the case, that computational constraints prevent access to the largest system sizes which would provide accurate estimates of critical parameters. To help deal with this difficulty, finite-size scaling (FSS) methods have been developed to allow extraction of bulk critical properties from simulations of finite size. FSS will be discussed in&nbsp;<a href="#sec:fss" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:fss">9.7</a>.</p>

<h1>The Renormalisation Group Theory of Critical Phenomena</h1>
<p><em>Owing the the absence of a wholly appropriate textbook for the material covered in this section, I have supplied more detailed notes than used in other parts of the unit.</em></p>
<p>The critical region is characterised by correlated microstructure on <span class="math inline">\(\underline{all}\)</span> length-scales up to and including the correlation length. Such a profusion of degrees of freedom can only be accurately characterized by a very large number of variables. Mean field theories and approximation schemes fail in the critical region because they at best incorporate interactions among only a few spins, while neglecting correlations over larger distances. Similarly, the scaling hypothesis fails to provide more than a qualitative insight into the nature of criticality because it focuses on only one length-scale, namely the correlation length itself. Evidently a fuller understanding of the critical region may only be attained by taking account of the existence of structure on all length-scales. Such a scheme is provided by the renormalisation group method, which stands today as the cornerstone of the modern theory of critical phenomena.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-critical-point-a-many-length-scale-problem">The critical point: A many length scale problem</h2>
<p>A near critical system can be characterized by three important length scales, namely</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The correlation length, <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>, ie the size of correlated microstructure.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimum length scale <span class="math inline">\(L_\textrm{ min}\)</span>, i.e.&nbsp;the smallest length in the microscopics of the problem, e.g.&nbsp;lattice spacing of a magnet or the particle size in a fluid.</p></li>
<li><p>Macroscopic size <span class="math inline">\(L_{max}\)</span> eg. size of the system.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The authentic critical region is defined by a window condition:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L_\textrm{ max} \gg \xi \gg L_\textrm{ min}\]</span></p>
<p>The physics of this regime is hard to tackle by analytic theory because it is characterized by configurational structure on all scales between <span class="math inline">\(L_\textrm{ min}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> (in fact it turns out that the near critical configurational patterns are <em>fractal</em>-like, cf. fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:snapshots" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:snapshots">5</a>(b)). Moreover different length scales are correlated with one another, giving rise to a profusion of coupled variables in any theoretical description. The window regime is also not easily accessed by computer simulation because it entails studying very large system sizes <span class="math inline">\(L_\textrm{

</section>
<section id="sec:rgmethod" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:rgmethod">Methodology of the RG</h2>
<p>The central idea of the renormalisation group (RG) method is a stepwise elimination of the degrees of freedom of the system on successively larger length-scales. To achieve this one introduces a fourth length scale <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. In contrast to the other three, which characterize the system itself, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> characterises the <em>description</em> of the system. It may be thought of as typifying the size of the smallest resolvable detail in a description of the system’s microstructure.</p>
<p>Consider the Ising model arrangements displayed in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:snapshots" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:snapshots">5</a>(a)-(c). These pictures contain <em>all</em> the details of each configuration shown: the resolution length <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> in this case has its smallest possible value, coinciding with the lattice spacing i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(L=L_{\min}\)</span>. In the present context, the most detailed description is not the most useful: the essential signals with which we are concerned are hidden in a noise of relevant detail. A clue to eliminating this noise lies in the nature of the correlation length, i.e.&nbsp;the size of the largest droplets. The explicit form of the small scale microstructure is irrelevant to the behaviour of <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>. The small scale microstructure is the noise. To eliminate it, we simply select a larger value of the resolution length (or ‘coarse-graining’ length) <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are many ways of implementing this coarse-graining procedure. We adopt a simple strategy in which we divide our sample into blocks of side <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, each of which contains <span class="math inline">\(L^d\)</span> sites, with <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> the space dimensions . The centres of the blocks define a lattice of points indexed by <span class="math inline">\(I=1,2,....,N/L^d\)</span>. We associate with each block lattice point centre, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, a coarse-grained or block variable <span class="math inline">\(S_I(L)\)</span> defined as the spatial average of the local variables it contains:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S_I(L)=L^{-d}\sum_i^Is_i
\label{eq:blkvar}\]</span> where the sum extends over the <span class="math inline">\(L^d\)</span> sites in the block <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. The set of coarse grained coordinates <span class="math inline">\(\{S(L)\}\)</span> are the basic ingredients of a picture of the system having spatial resolution of order <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.</p>
<p>The coarse graining operation is easily implemented on a computer. In so doing one is faced with the fact that while the underlying Ising spins can only take two possible values, the block variables <span class="math inline">\(S_I(L)\)</span> have <span class="math inline">\(L^d+1\)</span> possible values. Accordingly in displaying the consequences of the blocking procedure, we need a more elaborate colour convention than that used in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:snapshots" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:snapshots">5</a>. We will associate with each block a shade of grey drawn from a spectrum ranging from black to white.</p>

</div>
<p>The results of coarse-graining configurations typical of three different temperatures are shown in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:c1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:c1">15</a> and fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:c2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:c2">16</a>. Two auxiliary operations are implicit in these results. The first operation is a <em>length scaling</em>: the lattice spacing on each blocked lattice has been scaled to the same size as that of the original lattice, making possible the display of correspondingly larger portions of the physical system. The second operation is a <em>variable scaling</em>: loosely speaking, we have adjusted the scale (‘contrast’) of the block variable so as to match the spectrum of block variable values to the spectrum of shades at our disposal.</p>
<p>Consider first a system marginally above its critical point at a temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> chosen so that the correlation length <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> is approximately 6 lattice spacing units. A typical arrangement (without coarse-graining) is shown in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:c1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:c1">15</a>(ai). The succeeding figures, &nbsp;<a href="#fig:c1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:c1">15</a>(aii) and &nbsp;<a href="#fig:c1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:c1">15</a>(aiii), show the result of coarse-graining with block sizes <span class="math inline">\(L=4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L=8\)</span>, respectively. A clear trend is apparent. The coarse-graining <em>amplifies</em> the consequences of the small deviation of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>. As <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is increased, the ratio of the size of the largest configurational features (<span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>) to the size of the smallest (<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>) is reduced. The ratio <span class="math inline">\(\xi/L\)</span> provides a natural measure of how ‘critical’ is a configuration. Thus the coarse-graining operation generates a representation of the system that is effectively less critical the larger the coarse-graining length. The limit point of this trend is the effectively fully disordered arrangement shown in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:c1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:c1">15</a>(aiii) and in an alternative form in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:c1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:c1">15</a>(aiv), which shows the limiting distribution of the coarse grained variables, averaged over many realizations of the underlying configurations: the distribution is a Gaussian which is narrow (even more so the larger the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> value) and centred on zero. This limit is easily understood. When the system is viewed on a scaled <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> larger than <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>, the correlated microstructure is no longer explicitly apparent; each coarse-grained variable is essentially independent of the others.</p>
<p>A similar trend is apparent below the critical point. Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:c1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:c1">15</a>(bi) show a typical arrangement at a temperature <span class="math inline">\(T&lt;T_c\)</span> such that again <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> is approximately <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> lattice spacings. Coarse-graining with <span class="math inline">\(L=4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L=8\)</span> again generates representations which are effectively less critical (figs.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:c1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:c1">15</a>(bii) and (biii)). This time the coarse-graining smoothes out the microstructure which makes the order incomplete. The limit point of this procedure is a homogeneously ordered arrangement in which the block variables have a random (Gaussian) distribution centred on the order parameter (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:c1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:c1">15</a>(biv)).</p>
<p>Consider now the situation <em>at</em> the critical point. Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:c2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:c2">16</a>(ai) shows a typical arrangement; figs. &nbsp;<a href="#fig:c2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:c2">16</a>(aii) and (aiii) show the results of coarse-graining with <span class="math inline">\(L=4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L=8\)</span> respectively. Since the <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> is as large as the system itself the coarse graining does not produce less critical representations of the physical system: each of the figures displays structure over <em>all</em> length scales between the lower limit set by <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and the upper limit set by the size of the display itself. A limiting trend is nevertheless apparent. Although the <span class="math inline">\(L=4\)</span> pattern is qualitatively quite different from the pattern of the local variables, the <span class="math inline">\(L=4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L=8\)</span> patterns display qualitatively similar features. These similarities are more profound than is immediately apparent. A statistical analysis of the spectrum of <span class="math inline">\(L=4\)</span> configurations (generated as the local variables evolve in time) show that it is almost identical to that of the <span class="math inline">\(L=8\)</span> configurations (given the block variable scaling). The implication of this limiting behaviour is clear: the patterns formed by the ordering variable at criticality look the same (in a statistical sense) when viewed on all sufficiently large length scales.</p>

<p>Let us summarize. Under the coarse-graining operation there is an evolution or <em>flow</em> of the system’s configuration spectrum. The flow tends to a limit, or fixed point, such that the pattern spectrum does not change under further coarse-graining. These scale-invariant limits have a trivial character for <span class="math inline">\(T&gt;T_c\)</span>, (a perfectly disordered arrangement) and <span class="math inline">\(T
&lt; T_c\)</span>, (a perfectly ordered arrangement). The hallmark of the critical point is the existence of a scale-invariant limit which is neither fully ordered nor fully disordered but which possesses structure on all length scales.</p>

<section id="universality-and-scaling" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="universality-and-scaling">Universality and Scaling</h2>
<p>Equipped with the coarse-graining technique, we now address the universality phenomenon. We aim to understand how it is that systems that are different microscopically can nevertheless display critical point behaviour which (in certain respects) is quantitatively identical.</p>
<p>To obtain initial insight we introduce a spin-1 Ising model in which the spins take on three values (<span class="math inline">\(s_i=1,0,-1\)</span>), in contrast to the two values (<span class="math inline">\(s_i=1,-1\)</span>) of the spin-1/2 Ising model. The two models have properties which are different: for example, <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> for the three-state model is some <span class="math inline">\(30\%\)</span> lower than that of the two-state model (for the same coupling <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>). However, there is abundant evidence that the two models have the same universal properties.</p>
<p>Let us explore what is the same and what is different in the configurations of the two models at criticality. The configurations of the local variables <span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span> are clearly qualitatively different for the two models. Now consider the coarse-grained configurations (with <span class="math inline">\(L=4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L=8\)</span> respectively) for the three-state model at the critical point. We have already seen that the coarse-graining operation bears the configuration spectrum of the critical two-state Ising model to a non-trivial scale-invariant limit. It is scarcely surprising that the same is true for the three-state model. What is remarkable is that the two limits are the same! This is expressed in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:c2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:c2">16</a>(iv), which shows the near coincidence of the distribution of block variables (grey-levels) for the two different coarse-graining lengths. Thus the coarse-graining erases the physical differences apparent in configurations where the local behaviour is resolvable, and exposes a profound configurational similarity.</p>
<section id="fluid-magnet-universality" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fluid-magnet-universality">Fluid-magnet universality</h3>
<p>Let us now turn to fluid-magnet universality. In a magnet, the relevant configurations are those formed by the coarse-grained magnetisation (the magnetic moment averaged over a block of side <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>). In a fluid, the relevant configurations are those of the coarse-grained density (the mass averaged over a block if side <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>) or more precisely, its fluctuation from its macroscopic average (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:fmcoarse" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:fmcoarse">17</a>). The patterns in the latter (bubbles of liquid or vapour) may be matched to pattern in the former (microdomains of the magnetisation), given appropriate scaling operations to camouflage the differences between the length scales and the differences between the variable scales.</p>

<p>The similarity of coarse-grained configurations of different systems is not restricted to the critical temperature itself. Suppose we have a two state spin model and a three state spin model each somewhat above their critical points at reduced temperature <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The two systems will have somewhat different correlation lengths, <span class="math inline">\(\xi_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\xi_2\)</span> say.

We adjust the scales of the block variables (our grey level control) so that the typical variable value is the same for the two systems. We adjust the length scale of the systems (stretch or shrink our snapshots) so that the sizes of the minimum-length-scale structure (set by <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>) looks the same for each system. Precisely what they look like depends upon our choice of <span class="math inline">\(\xi/L\)</span>.</p>

<section id="sec:unipics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:unipics">Universality classes</h2>
<p>Coarse graining does not erase all differences between the physical properties of critical systems. Differences in the space dimension <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> of two critical systems will lead to different universal properties such as critical exponents. Thus, for instance, the critical exponents of the 2D magnet, match those of the 2d fluid, but they are different to those of 3d magnets and fluids.</p>
<p>In fact the space dimension is one of a small set of qualitative features of a critical system which are sufficiently deep-seated to survive coarse graining and which together serve to define the system’s universal behaviour, or <em>universality class</em>. The constituents of this set are not all identifiable <em>a priori</em>. They include the number of components <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of the order parameter. Up to now, we have only considered order parameters which are scalar (for a fluid the density, for a magnet the magnetisation), for which <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span>. In some ferromagnets, the order parameter may have components along two axes, or three axes, implying a vector order parameter, with <span class="math inline">\(n=2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span>, respectively. It is clear that the order-parameter <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-value will be reflected in the nature of the coarse-grained configurations, and thus in the universal observables they imply.</p>
<p>A third important feature which can change the universality class of a critical system is the range of the interaction potential between its constituent particles. Clearly for the Ising model, interactions between spins are inherently nearest neighbour in character. Most fluids interact via dispersion forces (such as the Lennard-Jones potential) which is also short ranged owing to the <span class="math inline">\(r^{-6}\)</span> attractive interaction. However some systems have much longer ranged interactions. Notable here are systems of charged particles which interact via a Coulomb potential. The long ranged nature of the Coulomb potential (which decays like <span class="math inline">\(r^{-1}\)</span>) means that charged systems often do not have the same critical exponents as the Ising model and fluid.</p>
</section>
<section id="critical-exponents" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="critical-exponents">Critical exponents</h2>
<p>We consider now how the critical exponents, may be computed via the coarse-graining procedure. In what follows we will refer only to the behaviour of a single typical coarse grained variable, which we shall denote <span class="math inline">\(S(L)\)</span>. We suppose that <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is sufficiently small that <span class="math inline">\(\xi \gg
L_\textrm{ min}\)</span>. Universality and scaling may be expressed in the claim that, for <em>any</em> <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, scale factors <span class="math inline">\(a(L)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b(L)\)</span> may be found such that the probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(p(S(L),t)\)</span> can be written in the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p(S(L),t)=b(L)\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)
\label{eq:blocks}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{p}\)</span> is a function unique to a universality class. The role of the scale factors <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is to absorb the basic non-universal scales identified in sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:rgmethod" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:rgmethod">9.2</a>. The critical exponents are implicit in the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-dependence of these scale factors. Specifically one finds:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
a(L)&amp;=&amp;a_0L^{1/\nu} \\
b(L)&amp;=&amp;b_0L^{\beta/\nu}
\label{eq:scalefacs}
\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>where the amplitudes <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> are system specific (non-universal) constants.</p>
<p>These results state that the critical exponents (in the form <span class="math inline">\(1/\nu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta/\nu\)</span>) characterize the ways in which the configuration spectrum evolves under coarse-graining. Consider, first the exponent ratio <span class="math inline">\(\beta/\nu\)</span>. Precisely at the critical point, there is only one way in which the coarse-grained configurations change with <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>: the overall scale of the coarse-grained variable (the black-white contrast in our grey scale representation) is eroded with increasing <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. Thus the configurations of coarse-graining length <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> match those of a larger coarse-graining length <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> only if the variable scale in the latter configurations is amplified. The required amplification follows from eqns.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:blocks" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:blocks">[eq:blocks]</a> and&nbsp;<a href="#eq:scalefacs" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:scalefacs">[eq:scalefacs]</a>: it is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{b(L_2)}{b(L_1)}=\left(\frac{L_2}{L_1}\right)^{\beta/\nu}\:.\]</span> The exponent ratio <span class="math inline">\(\beta/\nu\)</span> thus controls the rate at which the scale of the ordering variable decays with increasing coarse-graining length.</p>
<p>Consider now the exponent <span class="math inline">\(1/\nu\)</span>. For small but non-zero reduced temperature (large but finite <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>) there is second way in which the configuration spectrum evolves with <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. As noted previously, coarse graining reduces the ratio of correlation length to coarse-graining length, and results in configurations with a less critical appearance. More precisely, we see from eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:blocks" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:blocks">[eq:blocks]</a> that increasing the coarse graining length from <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> while keeping the reduced temperature constant has the same effect on the configuration spectrum as keeping coarse-graining length constant which amplifying the reduced temperature <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> by a factor</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{a(L_2)}{a(L_1)}=\left(\frac{L_2}{L_1}\right)^{1/\nu}\:.\]</span> One may think of the combination <span class="math inline">\(a(L)t\)</span> as a measure of the effective reduced temperature of the physical system viewed with resolution length <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.

Consideration of eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:blkvar" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:blkvar">[eq:blkvar]</a> shows that this is non other than the value of the order parameter <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, measured over a block of side <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. Thus from the definition of an average</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q(L,t)=\bar {S}(L,t)=\int S(L)p(S(L),t)dS(L)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(p(S(L))\)</span> is the probability distribution of <span class="math inline">\(S(L)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Making use of the representation of eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:blocks" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:blocks">[eq:blocks]</a>, we then have that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q(L,t) = \int b(L)S(L)\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)dS(L)\]</span></p>
<p>To integrate this we need to change the integration variable from <span class="math inline">\(S(L)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b(L)S(L)\)</span>. We have <span class="math inline">\(d(b(L)S(L))=b(L)dS(L)\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(b(L)\)</span> does not fluctuate. Thus</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
Q(L,t)    &amp;=&amp; b^{-1}(L)\int b(L)S(L)\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)d(b(L)S(L))\nonumber\\
       &amp;=&amp; b^{-1}(L)f(a(L)t)\nonumber\\
       &amp;=&amp; b_0L^{-\beta/\nu}f(a_0L^{1/\nu}t)
\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a universal function (defined as the first moment of <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{p}(x,y)\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>).</p>
<p>The above results provide a method for determining the critical exponent ratios <span class="math inline">\(\beta/\nu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1/\nu\)</span> via computer simulations of near critical systems. For instance, at the critical point (<span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>) and for finite block size, <span class="math inline">\(Q(L,0)\)</span> will not be zero (the <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> at which Q vanishes for finite <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is above the true <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>, cf. sec&nbsp;<a href="#sec:compsim" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:compsim">8.2</a>). However, we know that its value must vanish in the limit of infinite <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>; it does so like</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q(L,0)=b_0L^{-\beta/\nu}f(0)\equiv Q_0L^{-\beta/\nu}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus by studying the critical point <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> dependence of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> we can estimate <span class="math inline">\(\beta/\nu\)</span>. A similar approach in which we study two block sizes <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, and tune <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> separately in each case so that the results for <span class="math inline">\(QL^{\beta/\nu}\)</span> are identical provides information on the value of <span class="math inline">\(1/\nu\)</span>.</p>

<section id="the-renormalisation-group-effective-coupling-viewpoint" class="level1">
<h1>The renormalisation group: effective coupling viewpoint</h1>
<p>Let us begin by returning to our fundamental equation (eq. <a href="#eq:probs" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:probs">[eq:probs]</a>), which we rewrite as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p = Z^{-1}e^{-{\cal H}}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}\equiv E/k_BT\)</span>.</p>
<p>The first step is then to imagine that we generate, by a computer simulation procedure for example, a sequence of configurations with relative probability <span class="math inline">\(\exp(-{\cal H})\)</span>. We next adopt some coarse-graining procedure which produces from these original configurations a set of coarse-grained configurations. We then ask the question: what is the energy function <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}^\prime\)</span> of the coarse-grained variables which would produce these coarse-grained configurations with the correct relative probability <span class="math inline">\(\exp(-{\cal H}^\prime)\)</span>? Clearly the form of <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}^\prime\)</span> depends on the form of <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}\)</span> thus we can write symbolically</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\cal H}^\prime=R({\cal H})\]</span></p>
<p>The operation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, which defines the coarse-grained configurational energy in terms of the microscopic configurational energy function is known as a renormalisation group transformation (RGT). What it does is to replace a hard problem by a less hard problem. Specifically, suppose that our system is near a critical point and that we wish to calculate its large-distance properties. If we address this task by utilizing the configurational energy and appealing to the basic machinery of statistical mechanics set out in eqs.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:probs" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:probs">[eq:probs]</a> and &nbsp;<a href="#eq:partition" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:partition">[eq:partition]</a>, the problem is hard. It is hard because the system has fluctuations on all the (many) length scales intermediate between the correlation length <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> and the minimum length scale <span class="math inline">\(L_\textrm{
min}\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, the task may instead be addressed by tackling the coarse-grained system described by the energy <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}^\prime\)</span>. The large-distance properties of this system are the same as the large-distance properties of the physical system, since coarse-graining operation preserves large-scale configurational structure. In this representation the problem is a little easier: while the <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> associated with <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}^\prime\)</span> is the same as the <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> associated with <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}\)</span>, the minimum length scale of <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}^\prime\)</span> is bigger than that of <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}\)</span>. Thus the statistical mechanics of <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}^\prime\)</span> poses a not-quite-so-many-length-scale problem, a problem which is effectively a little less critical and is thus a little easier to solve. The benefits accruing from this procedure may be amplified by repeating it. Repeated application of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> will eventually result in a coarse- grained energy function describing configurations in which the <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> is no bigger than the minimum length scale. The associated system is far from criticality and its properties may be reliably computed by any of a wide variety of approximation schemes. These properties are the desired large-distance properties of the physical system. As explicit reference to fluctuations of a given scale is eliminated by coarse-graining, their effects are carried forward implicitly in the parameters of the coarse-grained energy.</p>
<p>In order to setup the framework for a simple illustrative example, let is return to the lattice Ising model for which the energy function depended only on the product of nearest neighbour spins. The coefficient of this product in the energy is the exchange coupling, <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>. In principle, however, other kinds of interactions are also allowed; for example, we may have a product of second neighbour spins with strength <span class="math inline">\(J_2\)</span> or, perhaps, a product of four spins (at sites forming a square whose side is the lattice spacing), with strength <span class="math inline">\(J_3\)</span>. Such interactions in a real magnet have their origin in the quantum mechanics of the atoms and electrons and clearly depend upon the details of the system. For generality therefore we will allow a family of exchange couplings <span class="math inline">\(J_1\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(J_2\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(J_3,\dots\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(J_a, a =
1,2,\dots\)</span> In reduced units, the equivalent coupling strengths are <span class="math inline">\(K_a =J_a/k_BT\)</span>. Their values determine uniquely the energy for any given configuration.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Now consider the coarse-graining procedure. Let us suppose that this procedure takes the form of a ‘majority rule’ operation in which the new spins are assigned values <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> according to the signs of the magnetic moments of the blocks with which they are associated. The new energy function <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}^\prime\)</span> will be expressible in terms of some new coupling strengths <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime\)</span> describing the interactions amongst the new spin variables (and thus, in effect, the interactions between blocks of the original spin variables). The RGT simply states that these new couplings depend on the old couplings: <span class="math inline">\(K_1^\prime\)</span> is some function <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> of all the original couplings, and generally</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[K^\prime_a=f_a(K_1,K_2,\dots) =f_a({\bf K}),~~~~ a= 1, 2,\dots
\label{eq:rgt}\]</span> where <strong>K</strong> is shorthand for the set <span class="math inline">\(K_1, K_2,\dots\)</span></p>
<section id="a-simple-example" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-simple-example">A simple example</h2>
<p>This example illustrates how one can perform the RG transformation (<a href="#eq:rgt" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:rgt">[eq:rgt]</a>) directly, without recourse to a ‘sequence of typical configurations’. The calculation involves a very crude approximation which has the advantage that it simplifies the subsequent analysis.</p>

</div>
<p>Consider an Ising model in two dimensions, with only nearest neighbour interactions as shown in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:rglat" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:rglat">19</a>. We have divided the spins into two sets, the spins <span class="math inline">\(\{s^\prime\}\)</span> form a square lattice of spacing <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, the others being denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\{\tilde{s}\}\)</span>. One then defines an effective energy function <span class="math inline">\({\cal H^\prime}\)</span> for the <span class="math inline">\(s^\prime\)</span> spins by performing an average over all the possible arrangements of the <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{s}\)</span> spins</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\exp(-{\cal H}^\prime)=\sum_{\{\tilde {s}\}} \exp(-{\cal H}).
\label{eq:decimate}\]</span></p>
<p>This particular coarse-graining scheme is called ‘decimation’ because a certain fraction (not necessarily one-tenth!) of spins on the lattice is eliminated. This formulation of a new energy function realizes two basic aims of the RG method: the long-distance physics of the ‘original’ system, described by <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}\)</span>, is contained in that of the ‘new’ system, described by <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}^\prime\)</span> (indeed the partition functions are the same as one can see by summing both sides over <span class="math inline">\(s^\prime\)</span>) and the new system is further from critically because the ratio of <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> to lattice spacing (‘minimum length scale’) has been reduced by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> (the ratio of the lattice spacings of the two systems). We must now face the question of how to perform the configuration sum in eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:decimate" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:decimate">[eq:decimate]</a>. This cannot in general be done exactly, so we must resort to some approximation scheme. The particular approximation which we invoke is the high temperature series expansion which was touched upon in sec.&nbsp;<a href="#sec:series" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:series">7</a>. In its simplest mathematical form, since <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}\)</span> contains a factor <span class="math inline">\(1/k_BT\)</span>, it involves the expansion of <span class="math inline">\(\exp(-{\cal H})\)</span> as a power series:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\exp(-{\cal H}/k_BT)=1-{\cal H}/k_BT +\frac{1}{2!}({\cal H}/k_BT)^2+.....\]</span></p>
<p>We substitute this expansion into the right hand side of eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:decimate" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:decimate">[eq:decimate]</a> and proceed to look for terms which depend on the <span class="math inline">\(s^\prime\)</span> spins after the sum over the possible arrangements of the <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{s}\)</span> spins is performed. This sum extends over all the possible (<span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>) values of all the <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{s}\)</span> spins. The first term (the 1) in the expansion of the exponential is clearly independent of the values of the <span class="math inline">\(s^\prime\)</span> spins. The second term (<span class="math inline">\({\cal H}\)</span>) is a function of the <span class="math inline">\(s^\prime\)</span> spins, but gives zero when the sum over the <span class="math inline">\(s^\prime\)</span> spins is performed because only a single factor of any <span class="math inline">\(s^\prime\)</span> ever appears, and <span class="math inline">\(+ 1 - 1 = 0\)</span>. The third term (<span class="math inline">\({\cal H}^2/2\)</span>) does contribute. If one writes out explicitly the form of <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}^2/2\)</span> one finds terms of the form <span class="math inline">\(K^2s_1^\prime\tilde{s}\tilde{s}s_2^\prime=K^2s_1^\prime s_2^\prime\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(s_1^\prime\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_2^\prime\)</span> denote two spins at nearest neighbour sites on the lattice of <span class="math inline">\(s^\prime\)</span> spins and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{s}\)</span> is the spin (in the other set) which lies between them. Now, in the corresponding expansion of the left hand side of eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:decimate" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:decimate">[eq:decimate]</a>, we find terms of the form <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime s_1^\prime s_2^\prime\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime\)</span> is the nearest neighbour coupling for the <span class="math inline">\(s^\prime\)</span> spins. We conclude (with a little more thought than we detail here) that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[K^\prime=K^2
\label{eq:rgdec}\]</span></p>
<p>Of course many other terms and couplings are generated by the higher orders of the high temperature expansion and it is necssary to include these if one wishes reliable values for the critical temperature and exponents, However, our aim here is to use this simple calculation to illustrate the RG method. Let us therefore close our eyes, forget about the higher order terms and show how the RGT (eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:rgdec" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:rgdec">[eq:rgdec]</a>) can be used to obtain information on the phase transition.</p>

<figcaption>Coupling flow under the decimation transformation described in the text.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The first point to note is that that mathematically eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:rgdec" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:rgdec">[eq:rgdec]</a> has the fixed point <span class="math inline">\(K^*= 1\)</span>; if <span class="math inline">\(K= 1\)</span> then the new effective coupling <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime\)</span> has the same value <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Further, if <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is just larger than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime\)</span> is larger than <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, i.e.&nbsp;further away from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Similarly, if <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is less than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime\)</span> is less than <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. We say that the fixed point is unstable: the flow of couplings under repeated iteration of eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:rgdec" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:rgdec">[eq:rgdec]</a> is away from the fixed point, as illustrated in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:flow1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:flow1">20</a>. The physical significance of this is as follows: suppose that the original system is at its critical point so that the ratio of <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> to lattice spacing is infinite. After one application of the decimation transformation, the effective lattice spacing has increased by a factor of two, but this ratio remains infinite; the new system is therefore also at its critical point. Within the approximations inherent in eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:rgdec" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:rgdec">[eq:rgdec]</a>, the original system is an Ising model with nearest neighbour coupling <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and the new system is an Ising model with nearest neighbour coupling <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime\)</span>. If these two systems are going to be at a common critically, we must identify <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime=
K\)</span>. The fixed point <span class="math inline">\(K^*= 1\)</span> is therefore a candidate for the critical point <span class="math inline">\(K_c\)</span>, where the phase transition occurs. This interpretation is reinforced by considering the case where the original system is close to, but not at, criticality. Then <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> is finite and the new system is further from critically because the ratio of <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> to lattice spacing is reduced by a factor of two. This instability of a fixed point to deviations of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(K^*\)</span> is a further necessary condition for its interpretation as a critical point of the system. In summary then we make the prediction</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[K_c=J/k_BT_c=1
\label{eq:Kc}\]</span></p>
<p>We can obtain further information about the behaviour of the system close to its critical point. In order to do so, we rewrite the transformation (eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:rgdec" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:rgdec">[eq:rgdec]</a>) in terms of the deviation of the coupling from its fixed point value. A Taylor expansion of the function <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime=K^2\)</span> yields</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
K^\prime &amp;=&amp; (K^*)^2 +(K-K^*)\left.\frac{\partial K^\prime}{\partial K}\right|_{K=K^*}+\frac{1}{2}(K-K^*)^2\left.\frac{\partial^2 K^\prime}{\partial K^2}\right|_{K=K^*}+\ldots\nonumber\\
K^\prime - K^* &amp;=&amp; 2 (K - K^*)+ (K - K^*)^2
\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>where in the second line we have used the fact that the first derivative evaluates to <span class="math inline">\(2K^*=2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((K^*)^2=K^*\)</span>.</p>
<p>For a system sufficiently close to its critical temperature the final term can be neglected. The deviation of the coupling from its fixed point (critical) value is thus bigger for the new system than it is for the old by a factor of two. This means that the reduced temperature is also bigger by a factor of two:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[t^\prime= 2t\]</span></p>
<p>But <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> (in units of the appropriate lattice spacing) is smaller by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\xi^\prime= \xi/2\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, when we double <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, we halve <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>, implying that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\xi\propto t^{-1}\]</span></p>
<p>for <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> close to <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>. Thus we see that the RGT predicts scaling behaviour with calculable critical exponents. In this simple calculation we estimate the critical exponent <span class="math inline">\(\nu=1\)</span> for the square lattice Ising model. This prediction is actually in agreement with the exactly established value. The agreement is fortuitous- the prediction in Eq.&nbsp;refeq:Kc for <span class="math inline">\(K_c\)</span>, is larger than the exactly established value by a factor of more than two. In order to obtain reliable estimates more sophisticated and systematic methods must be used.</p>
<p>The crude approximation in the calculation above produced a transformation, eq.&nbsp;<a href="#eq:rgdec" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:rgdec">[eq:rgdec]</a>, involving only the nearest neighbour coupling, with the subsequent advantages of simple algebra. We pay a penalty for this simplicity in two ways: the results obtained for critical properties are in rather poor agreement with accepted values, and we gain no insight into the origin of universality.</p>

<figcaption>General flow in coupling space</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:flow2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:flow2">21</a> is a representation of the space of all coupling strengths <span class="math inline">\(K_a\)</span> in the energy function <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}/k_BT\)</span>. This is of course actually a space of infinite dimension, but representing three of these, as we have done, enables us to illustrate all the important aspects. First let us be clear what the points in this space represent. Suppose we have some magnetic material which is described by a given set of exchange constants <span class="math inline">\(J_1,J_2,J_3.....\)</span> As the temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> varies, the coupling strengths <span class="math inline">\(K_a=J_a/k_BT\)</span> trace out a straight line, or ray, from the origin of the space in the direction (<span class="math inline">\(J_1,J_2,J_3 ....\)</span> ). Points on this ray close to the origin represent this magnet at high temperatures, and conversely points far from the origin represent the magnet at low temperatures. The critical point of the magnet is represented by a specific point on this ray, <span class="math inline">\(K_a=
J_a/k_BT, a= 1,2,\dots\)</span> The set of critical points on all of the possible rays forms a <em>surface</em>, the critical surface. Formally, it is defined by the set of all possible models (of the Ising type) which have infinite <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>. It is shown schematically as the shaded surface in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:flow2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:flow2">21</a>. (In the figure it is a two-dimensional surface; more generally it has one dimension less than the full coupling constant space, dividing all models into high and low tempera- ture phases.)</p>
<p>Our immediate goal then is to understand how the RGT can explain why different physical systems near this critical surface have the same behaviour. Let us turn now to the schematic representation of the RG flow in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:flow2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:flow2">21</a>. Suppose we start with a physical system, with coupling strengths <span class="math inline">\(K_a,  a= 1,2, \dots\)</span>. What the RGT does is generate a new point in the figure, at the coupling strengths <span class="math inline">\(K_a^{(1)}=f_a({\bf K})\)</span>; these are the couplings appearing in the effective energy function describing the coarse-grained system. If we repeat the transformation, the new energy function has coupling strengths <span class="math inline">\(K_a^{(2)}=f_a({\bf K})\)</span>. Thus repeated application of the transformation generates a flow of points in the figure: <span class="math inline">\({\bf K\to
K^{(1)}\to\dots\to K^{(n)}}\)</span> where the superscript (<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>) labels the effective couplings after <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> coarse-graining steps. if the change in coarse-graining scale is <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(&gt; 1\)</span>) at each step, the total change in coarse-graining scale is <span class="math inline">\(b^n\)</span> after <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> steps. In the process, therefore, the ratio of <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> to coarse-graining scale is reduced by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(b^{-n}\)</span>. The dots in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:flow2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:flow2">21</a> identify three lines of RG flow starting from three systems differing only in their temperature. (The flow lines are schematic but display the essential features revealed in detailed calculations.)</p>
<p>Consider first the red dots which start from the nearest neighbour Ising model at its critical point. The ratio of <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> to coarse-graining scale is reduced by a factor b at each step, but, since it starts infinite, it remains infinite after any finite number of steps. In this case we can in principle generate an unbounded number of dots, <span class="math inline">\({\bf K^{(1)}, K^{(2)},\dots,K^{(n)}}\)</span>, all of which lie in the critical surface. The simplest behaviour of such a sequence as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> increases is to tend to a limit, <span class="math inline">\(K^*\)</span>, say. In such a case</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[K^*_a=f_a(K^*)~~~~ a= 1,2 .....\]</span></p>
<p>This point <span class="math inline">\({\bf K^*} \equiv K_1^*, K_2^*, \dots\)</span> is therefore a <em>fixed point</em> which lies in the critical surface.</p>
<p>By contrast, consider the same magnet as before, now at temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> just greater than <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>, its couplings <span class="math inline">\(K_a\)</span>, will be close to the first red dot (in fact they will be slightly smaller) and so will the effective couplings <span class="math inline">\(K_a^{(1)},K_2^{(2)},\dots\)</span> of the corresponding coarse-grained systems. The new flow will therefore appear initially to follow the red dots towards the same fixed point. However, the flow must eventually move away from the fixed point because each coarse-graining now produces a model further from criticality. The resulting flow is represented schematically by one set of black dots. The other set of black dots shows the expected flow starting from the same magnet slightly below its critical temperature.</p>
<p>We are now in a position to understand both universality and scaling within this framework. We will suppose that there exists a single fixed point in the critical surface which sucks in all flows starting from a point in that surface. Then any system at its critical point will exhibit large-length scale physics (large-block spin behaviour) described by the single set of fixed point coupling constants. The uniqueness of this limiting set of coupling constants is the essence of critical point universality. It is, of course, the algebraic counterpart of the unique limiting spectrum of coarse-grained configurations, discussed in sec&nbsp;<a href="#sec:unipics" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:unipics">9.5</a>. Similarly the scale-invariance of the critical point configuration spectrum (viewed on large enough length scales) is expressed in the invariance of the couplings under iteration of the transformation (after a number of iterations large enough to secure convergence to the fixed point).</p>
<p>To understand the behaviour of systems near but not precisely at critically we must make a further assumption (again widely justified by explicit studies). The flow line stemming from any such system will, we have argued, be borne towards the fixed point before ultimately deviating from it after a number of iterations large enough to expose the system’s noncritical character. We assume that (as indicated schematically in the streams of red and blue lines in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#fig:flow2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:flow2">21</a>) the deviations lie along a single line through the fixed point, the direction followed along this line differing according to the sign of the temperature deviation <span class="math inline">\(T-T_c\)</span>. Since any two sets of coupling constants on the line (on the same side of the fixed point) are related by a suitable coarse-graining operation, this picture implies that the large-length-scale physics of all near- critical systems differs only in the matter of a length scale. This is the essence of near-critical point universality.</p>
<p><strong>Phase transitions: Problems</strong></p>
<p>Although you should try all of these questions, some of them are deliberately quite challenging. If you don’t get very far with some, don’t worry. We’ll be going over them in problems classes, so you can just regard them as worked examples.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Existence of a phase transition in <span class="math inline">\(d=2\)</span>.</strong></p>
<p>(Straightforward) In lectures it was argued that no long ranged order occurs at finite-temperatures in a one dimensional system because of the presence of domain walls. Were macroscopic domain walls to exist in two dimensions at finite temperature, they would similarly destroy long ranged order and prevent a phase transition. By calculating the free energy of a 2D domain wall for an Ising lattice, show that domain walls do not in fact exist for sufficiently low <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<p>(<em>Hint: Model the domain wall as a non-reversing <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-step random walk on the lattice and find an expression for its energy and -from the number of random walk configurations- its entropy.</em>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correlation Length</strong></p>
<p>(Challenging) For a 1D Ising model, show that the correlation between the spins at sites <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\langle s_i s_j\rangle =\sum_m p_m(-1)^m\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the number of domain walls between <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_m\)</span> is the probability of finding <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> domain walls between them.</p>
<p>Hence show that when <span class="math inline">\(R_{ij}=|i-j|a\)</span> is large (with <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> the lattice spacing) and the temperature is small, that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\langle s_i s_j\rangle =\exp(-R_{ij}/\xi)\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\xi=a/2p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> the probability of finding a domain wall on a bond.</p>
<p><em>Hint: In the second part note that <span class="math inline">\(p_m\)</span> is given by a binomial distribution because there is a probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of each bond containing a domain wall and <span class="math inline">\((1-p)\)</span> that it doesn’t. What special type of distribution does <span class="math inline">\(p_m\)</span> tend to when <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is small (as occurs at low <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>)?</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>A model fluid</strong></p>
<p>(Straightforward) The van der Waals (vdW) equation of state (recall PH10002) is essentially a mean field theory for fluids. It relates the pressure and the volume of a fluid to the temperature:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left(P+\frac{a}{V^2}\right)(V-b)=N_Ak_BT\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are constants and <span class="math inline">\(N_A\)</span> is Avogadro’s number.</p>
<p>The critical point of a fluid corresponds to the point at which the isothermal compressibility diverges, that is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_T=0\]</span> Additionally, one finds that isotherms of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> exhibit a point of inflection at the critical point, that is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left(\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial V^2}\right)_T=0\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use these two requirements to show that the critical point of the vdW fluid is located at</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_c=3b, ~~~ P_c=\frac{a}{27b^2},~~~ N_AK_BT_c=\frac{8a}{27b}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Hence show that when written in terms of reduced variables</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p=\frac{P}{P_c}, ~~~~ v=\frac{V}{V_c} ~~~~ t=\frac{T}{T_c}\]</span></p>
<p>the equation takes the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left(p+\frac{3}{v^2}\right)(v-\frac{1}{3})=\frac{8t}{3}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Use a graph-plotting program such as “Excel” to plot a selection of isotherms close to the critical temperature (you will need to choose suitable units for your axes). Plot also the gradient and second derivative of P vs V on the critical isotherm and confirm numerically that it exhibits a point of inflection at the critical pressure and temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain the value of the critical exponent <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> of the vdW model and confirm that it takes a mean-field value.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Mean field theory of the Ising model heat capacity</strong></p>
<p>(Straightforward) Using results derived in lectures, obtain an expression for the mean energy <span class="math inline">\(\langle E\rangle\)</span> of the Ising model in zero field, within the simplest mean field approximation <span class="math inline">\(\langle
  s_is_j\rangle=\langle s_i\rangle\langle s_j\rangle=m^2\)</span>. Hence show that for <span class="math inline">\(H=0\)</span> the heat capacity <span class="math inline">\(\partial \langle
  E\rangle/\partial T\)</span> has the behaviour</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
C_H=&amp; 0 ~~~~ T&gt;T_c\\
C_H=&amp; 3Nk_B/2 ~~~~ T\le T_c
\end{aligned}\]</span></li>
<li><p><strong>Magnetisation and fluctuations</strong></p>
<p>(Slightly tricky) A system of spins on a lattice, has, in the absence of an applied field, a Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\({\cal H}\)</span>. In the presence of a field <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> the Hamiltonian becomes <span class="math display">\[\tilde {\cal H}={\cal H}-hM\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the total magnetisation and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is the magnetic field. By considering the partition function <span class="math inline">\(Z(T,h)\)</span> and its relationship to the free energy <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> show that in general</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\langle M \rangle=-\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial h}\right)_T\]</span></p>
<p>Show also that the variance of the magnetisation fluctuations is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\langle M^2\rangle-\langle M\rangle^2=-k_BT\left(\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial h^2}\right)_T\]</span></p>
<p>(<em>Hint: This is an important standard derivation found in many text books on Statistical Mechanics. You will need to differentiate <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> (twice) and use the product and chain rules.</em>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spin-1 Ising model</strong></p>
<p>(Straightforward) A set of spins on a lattice of coordination number <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> can take values <span class="math inline">\((-1,0,1)\)</span>, as opposed to just <span class="math inline">\((-1,1)\)</span> as in the spin-1/2 Ising model. The Hamiltonian is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\cal H}=-J\sum_{&lt;ij&gt;}s_is_j + h\sum_i s_i\]</span></p>
<p>Find the partition function and hence show that in the mean field approximation, the magnetisation per site obeys</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m=\frac{2\sinh[\beta(Jqm+h)]}{2\cosh[\beta(Jqm+h)]+1}\]</span></p>
<p>and find the critical temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> at which the net magnetisation vanishes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transfer Matrix.</strong></p>
<p>(Straightforward strategy but some lengthy algebra required)</p>
<p>Verify the calculation of the free energy of the 1D periodic chain Ising model in a field outlined in lectures using the Transfer Matrix method.</p>
<p>Use your results to show that the spontaneous magnetisation is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m=\frac{\sinh \beta H}{\sqrt{\sinh^2\beta H+\exp{-4\beta J}}}\]</span> Comment on the value of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> in zero field.</p>
<p>(<em>Hint: Follow the prescription given in lectures. Depending on your approach you may need to use the trigonometrical identities <span class="math inline">\(\cosh^2x-\sinh^2x=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\cosh(2x)=2\cosh^2x-1\)</span>.</em>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lattice gas model</strong> (Straightforward). Check the claim, made in lectures that the “Hamiltonian” of the Lattice Gas model in the grand canonical ensemble</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\cal H}_{LG}=-\epsilon\sum_{&lt;i,j&gt;}c_ic_j -\mu\sum_ic_i\]</span></p>
<p>is transformed to that of the Ising model by means of the change of variable</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s_i=2c_i-1;~~~~ J=\frac{\epsilon}{4}~~~~
h=\frac{\epsilon q+2\mu}{4}\]</span></p>
<p>(<em>Hint: Note that when doing sums over bonds <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{\langle
    i,j\rangle}\)</span> for a lattice of coordination <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> there are <span class="math inline">\(q/2\)</span> bonds per site since each bond is shared between two sites.</em>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Landau theory</strong></p>
<p>Check and complete the Landau theory calculations, given in lectures, for the critical exponents <span class="math inline">\(\gamma=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0\)</span> of the Ising model. For the latter, you should first prove the result</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_H =-T\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial T^2}\]</span> starting from the classical theormodynamics expression for changes in the free energy of a magnet <span class="math inline">\(dF=-SdT-MdH\)</span>.</p>
<p>(<em>Hint: If you get stuck with the proof see standard thermodynamics text books. To get the susceptibility exponent in Landau theory add a term <span class="math inline">\(-Hm\)</span> to the Hamiltonian.</em>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scaling laws</strong></p>
<p>(Straightforward.)Using the generalised homogeneous form for the free energy given in lectures, take appropriate derivatives to find the relationships to the critical exponents:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\beta=\frac{1-b}{a}; ~~ \gamma=\frac{2b-1}{a};~~ \delta= \frac{b}{1-b}; ~~~ \alpha=2-\frac{1}{a}.\]</span></p>
<p>Hence derive the scaling laws among the critical exponents:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\alpha+\beta(\delta+1)=2 \\
\alpha+2\beta+\gamma=2\\
%\gamma=\beta(\delta-1)
\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>(<em>Hint: For the heat capacity exponent <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> use the result from problem 9: <span class="math inline">\(C_H=-T\left(\frac{\partial^2F}{\partial T^2}\right)_{h=0}\)</span></em>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Renormalization Group transformation for the 1D Ising model</strong></p>
<p>(Challenging.) Consider a 1D Ising model of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> spins in zero field given by the Hamiltonian</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\cal H}_I/k_BT=-K\sum_{&lt;ij&gt;}s_is_j -\sum_iC\]</span> where a background term is included because even if set zero initially, it will be generated by an RG transformation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A renormalisation is to be implemented with a scale factor <span class="math inline">\(b=2\)</span>. By partially performing the sum in the partition function over the spins on the even numbered lattice sites, show that the partially summed partition function can be written</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z=\sum_{s_1,s_3,s_5...}\prod_{i=2,4,6...} [\exp
[K(s_{i-1}+s_{i+1})+2C] + \exp[-K(s_{i-1}+s_{i+1})+2C]\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Next, relabel the remaining (odd numbered) spins so that they are numbered consecutively eg by an index <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> (this is a matter of convenience only). Then cast this partially summed partition function in a form that makes it look the same as that for an Ising model with <span class="math inline">\(N/2\)</span> spins. i.e.&nbsp;require that <span class="math inline">\(Z^\prime\)</span> has the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z=\sum_{\{s\}}\prod_{j=1}^{N/2}\exp[K^\prime s_js_{j+1}+C^\prime]\:,\]</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(s_j,s_{j+1}=\pm 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Hence show that the effective coupling <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime\)</span>, and background constant <span class="math inline">\(C^\prime\)</span> of the renormalised system are related to those of the underlying Hamiltonian by</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\exp(K^\prime+C^\prime) &amp;=&amp; \exp(2C)[\exp(2K)+\exp(-2K)] \\
\exp(-K^\prime+C^\prime) &amp;=&amp; 2\exp(2C)
\end{aligned}\]</span></li>
<li><p>Use these results to show that the effective coupling flows under the renormalization according to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[K^\prime = (1/2)\ln (\cosh 2K)\]</span></p>
<p>Does this flow drive the effective coupling to the low or high temperature fixed point?</p></li>
<li><p>Finally show that the partition function transforms under the RG as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z(K,N)=2^{N/2}\exp(NK^\prime/2)Z(K^\prime,N/2)\]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note. The above is a hard question, which we’ll go over this in detail in a problems class. So if you don’t make much progress, don’t worry, just treat it as a worked example.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>RG flow of the free energy</strong></p>
<p>(Straightforward) An alternative RG equation for the effective coupling in the 1D Ising model is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[K = (1/2)\cosh^{-1}(\exp 2K^\prime)\]</span> which is the inverse of the transformation found in the previous question. This transformation thus drives the system from small effective coupling (high temperature) to high effective coupling (low temperature).</p>
<p>Under the transformation, the free energy density transforms like</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\beta f(K)=(1/2)\beta f(K^\prime)-(1/2)\ln 2-K^\prime/2\:.\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use these findings to iteratively calculate the free energy density of the Ising model at low temperatures, starting from the high temperature limit.</p>
<p><em>Hint: Start with a very low coupling eg. <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime=0.01\)</span>, and show that because interactions between spins are negligible, <span class="math inline">\(\beta f(K^\prime)\approx
-\ln 2\)</span>. Then iterate the RG equations above <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> or so times to generate a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta f(K)\)</span> values.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Compare your results for each iteration with the exact results for the free energy density of the 1D Ising model obtained in lectures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
