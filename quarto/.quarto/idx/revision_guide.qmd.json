Be able to differentiate the free energy to obtain thermodynamic observables and fluctuation relations for the heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility.\n\n- Know the forms of the singularities exhibited by key observables on the approach to criticality and be able to define the exponents $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $\\delta$ and $\\nu$.\n\n- Be able to draw the phase diagrams of magnetic and fluid systems and define the critical exponents. You should know the key differences between first and second order phase transitions.\n\n- Understand the isomorphism between the Ising model and lattice gas.\n\n- **Ising model**: Write down the Hamiltonian of the Ising model and be familiar with its properties in $d = 1, 2, 3$. Derive the Ising model free energy in $d = 1$ both in zero magnetic field (kink method) and in a finite field (Transfer matrix method).\n\n- **Mean field theory**: Show that the effective Hamiltonian \n  $$ H_{\\text{eff}} = H + qJm $$\n  and derive the equation \n  $$ m = \\tanh(\\beta H_{\\text{eff}}). $$\n  From this, find the behaviour of $m$ and $\\chi$ near $T_c$. Know the form of the spin-spin correlation function in mean field theory and use it to calculate the behaviour of the heat capacity near criticality. Describe the shortcomings of mean field theory and explain the underlying reasons.\n\n- **Landau theory**: Given the Landau free energy, sketch and interpret the form of the free energy as a function of magnetisation for a range of temperatures around $T_c$. Derive the values of the critical exponents $\\beta$, $\\delta$, $\\gamma$, $\\alpha$. Understand the genesis of first order phase transitions and metastability within Landau theory and the importance of symmetry considerations.\n\n- **Scaling theory**: Recast a generalised homogeneous function as a power law in one variable. Applying this to the free energy, deduce scaling forms for key observables and relationships between the scaling variables and the critical exponents. Deduce scaling laws relating the critical exponents. Describe experimental tests of scaling and its utility in the context of computer simulations of critical phenomena.\n\n- **Renormalization Group**: Describe the main purpose and features of the RG formalism in both the block variable and effective coupling approaches. Describe the relevance of the RG to scaling phenomena and universality. Know which essential qualitative features of a system delineate universality classes. Explain the key steps of a decimation calculation for the 1d Ising model in order to deduce the evolution of the effective coupling constant with successive coarse-graining.\n\n- **Classical nucleation theory**:.....\n\n\n- **Stochastic processes**:....\n\nSome of these items were mainly covered in the problem sheets. \n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\nIn addition to having worked through and being familiar with all the questions on the problem sheets, you are expected to:\n\n- Know the relationship between the free energy of a system and its partition function.
