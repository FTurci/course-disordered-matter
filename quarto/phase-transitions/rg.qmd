# Universality and the Renormalisation Group Theory of Critical Phenomena

*Owing the the absence of a wholly appropriate textbook for the material
covered in this section, I have supplied more detailed notes than used
in other parts of the unit.*

The critical region is characterised by correlated microstructure on
$\underline{all}$ length-scales up to and including the correlation
length. 



 Such a profusion of degrees of freedom can only be accurately
characterized by a very large number of variables. Mean field theories
and approximation schemes fail in the critical region because they at
best incorporate interactions among only a few spins, while neglecting
correlations over larger distances. Similarly, the scaling hypothesis
fails to provide more than a qualitative insight into the nature of
criticality because it focuses on only one length-scale, namely the
correlation length itself. Evidently a fuller understanding of the
critical region may only be attained by taking account of the existence
of structure on all length-scales. Such a scheme is provided by the
renormalisation group method, which stands today as the cornerstone of
the modern theory of critical phenomena.

## The critical point: A many length scale problem

A near critical system can be characterized by three important length
scales, namely

1.  The correlation length, $\xi$, ie the size of correlated
    microstructure.

2.  Minimum length scale $L_\textrm{ min}$, i.e. the smallest length in the
    microscopics of the problem, e.g. lattice spacing of a magnet or the
    particle size in a fluid.

3.  Macroscopic size $L_{max}$ eg. size of the system.

The authentic critical region is defined by a window condition:

$$L_\textrm{ max} \gg \xi \gg L_\textrm{ min}$$

The physics of this regime is hard to tackle by analytic theory because
it is characterized by configurational structure on all scales between
$L_\textrm{ min}$ and $\xi$ (in fact it turns out that the near critical
configurational patterns are *fractal*-like, cf. @fig-ssb. Moreover different length scales are
correlated with one another, giving rise to a profusion of coupled
variables in any theoretical description. The window regime is also not
easily accessed by computer simulation because it entails studying very
large system sizes $L_\textrm{
max}$, often requiring considerable computing resources.

A nice illustration of critical point scale invariance in the Ising model can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi-g2ET97W8&ab_channel=DouglasAshton).


## Methodology of the RG {#sec-rgmethod}

The central idea of the renormalisation group (RG) method is a stepwise
elimination of the degrees of freedom of the system on successively
larger length-scales. To achieve this one introduces a fourth length
scale $L$. In contrast to the other three, which characterize the system
itself, $L$ characterises the *description* of the system. It may be
thought of as typifying the size of the smallest resolvable detail in a
description of the system's microstructure.

Consider the Ising model arrangements displayed in
@fig-snapshots. These pictures contain *all* the
details of each configuration shown: the resolution length $L$ in this
case has its smallest possible value, coinciding with the lattice
spacing i.e. $L=L_{\min}$. In the present context, the most detailed
description is not the most useful: the essential signals with which we
are concerned are hidden in a noise of relevant detail. A clue to
eliminating this noise lies in the nature of the correlation length,
i.e. the size of the largest droplets. The explicit form of the small
scale microstructure is irrelevant to the behaviour of $\xi$. The small
scale microstructure is the noise. To eliminate it, we simply select a
larger value of the resolution length (or 'coarse-graining' length) $L$.

There are many ways of implementing this coarse-graining procedure. We
adopt a simple strategy in which we divide our sample into blocks of
side $L$, each of which contains $L^d$ sites, with $d$ the space
dimensions . The centres of the blocks define a lattice of points
indexed by $I=1,2,\ldots,N/L^d$. We associate with each block lattice
point centre, $I$, a coarse-grained or block variable $S_I(L)$ defined
as the spatial average of the local variables it contains:

$$
S_I(L)=L^{-d}\sum_i^Is_i
$${#eq-blkvar} 
where the sum extends over the $L^d$ sites in the
block $I$. The set of coarse grained coordinates $\{S(L)\}$ are the
basic ingredients of a picture of the system having spatial resolution
of order $L$.

The coarse graining operation is easily implemented on a computer. In so
doing one is faced with the fact that while the underlying Ising spins
can only take two possible values, the block variables $S_I(L)$ have
$L^d+1$ possible values. Accordingly in displaying the consequences of
the blocking procedure, we need a more elaborate colour convention than
that used in @fig-snapshots. We will associate with each block a shade of
grey drawn from a spectrum ranging from black to white.

The results of coarse-graining configurations typical of three different 
temperatures are shown in @fig-c1 and @fig-c2. Two auxiliary operations are implicit in these
results. The first operation is a *length scaling*: the lattice spacing
on each blocked lattice has been scaled to the same size as that of the
original lattice, making possible the display of correspondingly larger
portions of the physical system. The second operation is a *variable
scaling*: loosely speaking, we have adjusted the scale ('contrast') of
the block variable so as to match the spectrum of block variable values
to the spectrum of shades at our disposal.

Consider first a system marginally above its critical point at a
temperature $T$ chosen so that the correlation length $\xi$ is
approximately 6 lattice spacing units. A typical arrangement (without
coarse-graining) is shown in @fig-c1(ai). The succeeding panels, (aii) and (aiii), show the
result of coarse-graining with block sizes $L=4$ and $L=8$,
respectively. A clear trend is apparent. The coarse-graining *amplifies*
the consequences of the small deviation of $T$ from $T_c$. As $L$ is
increased, the ratio of the size of the largest configurational features
($\xi$) to the size of the smallest ($L$) is reduced. The ratio $\xi/L$
provides a natural measure of how 'critical' is a configuration. Thus
the coarse-graining operation generates a representation of the system
that is effectively less critical the larger the coarse-graining length.
The limit point of this trend is the effectively fully disordered
arrangement shown in @fig-c1(aiii)  and in an alternative form in @fig-c1(aiv), which
shows the limiting distribution of the coarse grained variables,
averaged over many realizations of the underlying configurations: the
distribution is a Gaussian which is narrow (even more so the larger the
$L$ value) and centred on zero. This limit is easily understood. When
the system is viewed on a scaled $L$ larger than $\xi$, the correlated
microstructure is no longer explicitly apparent; each coarse-grained
variable is essentially independent of the others.

A similar trend is apparent below the critical point.
@fig-c1(bi) show a
typical arrangement at a temperature $T<T_c$ such that again $\xi$ is
approximately $6$ lattice spacings. Coarse-graining with $L=4$ and $L=8$
again generates representations which are effectively less critical
as shown in panels (bii) and (biii)). This time the coarse-graining smoothes out the microstructure
which makes the order incomplete. The limit point of this procedure is a
homogeneously ordered arrangement in which the block variables have a
random (Gaussian) distribution centred on the order parameter
(@fig-c1(biv)).

Consider now the situation *at* the critical point. @fig-c2(ai) shows a
typical arrangement; panels (aii) and (aiii) show the results of coarse-graining
with $L=4$ and $L=8$ respectively. Since the $\xi$ is as large as the
system itself the coarse graining does not produce less critical
representations of the physical system: each of the figures displays
structure over *all* length scales between the lower limit set by $L$
and the upper limit set by the size of the display itself. A limiting
trend is nevertheless apparent. Although the $L=4$ pattern is
qualitatively quite different from the pattern of the local variables,
the $L=4$ and $L=8$ patterns display qualitatively similar features.
These similarities are more profound than is immediately apparent. A
statistical analysis of the spectrum of $L=4$ configurations (generated
as the local variables evolve in time) shows (@fig-c2(iv)) that it is almost identical
to that of the $L=8$ configurations (given the block variable scaling).
The implication of this limiting behaviour is clear: the patterns formed
by the ordering variable at criticality look the same (in a statistical
sense) when viewed on all sufficiently large length scales.

Let us summarize. Under the coarse-graining operation there is an
evolution or *flow* of the system's configuration spectrum. The flow
tends to a limit, or fixed point, such that the pattern spectrum does
not change under further coarse-graining. These scale-invariant limits
have a trivial character for $T>T_c$, (a perfectly disordered
arrangement) and $T< T_c$, (a perfectly ordered arrangement). The hallmark of the critical
point is the existence of a scale-invariant limit which is neither fully
ordered nor fully disordered but which possesses structure on all length
scales. A nice illustration of these points can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxRddFrEnPc).
 
## Universality and Scaling

Equipped with the coarse-graining technique, we now address the
universality phenomenon. We aim to understand how it is that systems
that are different microscopically can nevertheless display critical
point behaviour which (in certain respects) is quantitatively identical.

To obtain initial insight we introduce a spin-1 Ising model in which the
spins take on three values ($s_i=1,0,-1$), in contrast to the two values
($s_i=1,-1$) of the spin-1/2 Ising model. The two models have properties
which are different: for example, $T_c$ for the three-state model is
some $30\%$ lower than that of the two-state model (for the same
coupling $J$). However, there is abundant evidence that the two models
have the same universal properties.

Let us explore what is the same and what is different in the
configurations of the two models at criticality. The configurations of
the local variables $s_i$ are clearly qualitatively different for the
two models. Now consider the coarse-grained configurations (with $L=4$
and $L=8$ respectively) for the three-state model at the critical point.
We have already seen that the coarse-graining operation bears the
configuration spectrum of the critical two-state Ising model to a
non-trivial scale-invariant limit. It is scarcely surprising that the
same is true for the three-state model. What is remarkable is that the
two limits are the same! This is expressed in @fig-c2(iv), which
shows the near coincidence of the distribution of block variables
(grey-levels) for the two different coarse-graining lengths. Thus the
coarse-graining erases the physical differences apparent in
configurations where the local behaviour is resolvable, and exposes a
profound configurational similarity.

### Fluid-magnet universality

Let us now turn to fluid-magnet universality. In a magnet, the relevant
configurations are those formed by the coarse-grained magnetisation (the
magnetic moment averaged over a block of side $L$). In a fluid, the
relevant configurations are those of the coarse-grained density (the
mass averaged over a block if side $L$) or more precisely, its
fluctuation from its macroscopic average (@fig-fmcoarse). The patterns in the latter (bubbles of
liquid or vapour) may be matched to pattern in the former (microdomains
of the magnetisation), given appropriate scaling operations to
camouflage the differences between the length scales and the differences
between the variable scales.

A movie in which we progressively zoom out shows how the loss of microscopic details reveals the large lengthscale universal features.
{{< video Movies/universality.mov title="Zooming out">}}

## Near critical scaling

The similarity of coarse-grained configurations of different systems is
not restricted to the critical temperature itself. Suppose we have a two
state spin model and a three state spin model each somewhat above their
critical points at reduced temperature $t$. The two systems will have
somewhat different correlation lengths, $\xi_1$ and $\xi_2$ say. Suppose
however, we choose coarse-graining lengths $L_1$ for $L_2$ for the two
models such that $\xi_1/L_1=\xi_2/L_2$. We adjust the scales of the
block variables (our grey level control) so that the typical variable
value is the same for the two systems. We adjust the length scale of the
systems (stretch or shrink our snapshots) so that the sizes of the
minimum-length-scale structure (set by $L_1$ and $L_2$) looks the same
for each system. Precisely what they look like depends upon our choice
of $\xi/L$.

## Universality classes {#sec-unipics}

Coarse graining does not erase all differences between the physical
properties of critical systems. Differences in the space dimension $d$
of two critical systems will lead to different universal properties such
as critical exponents. Thus, for instance, the critical exponents of the
2D magnet, match those of the 2d fluid, but they are different to those
of 3d magnets and fluids.

|                          | $d=2$             | $d=3$             |
|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Critical temperature     | 0.5673            | 0.75              |
| Order parameter exponent $\beta$ | $\tfrac{1}{8}$      | $0.325 \pm 0.001$ |
| Susceptibility exponent $\gamma$ | $\tfrac{7}{4}$      | $1.24 \pm 0.001$  |
| Correlation length exponent $\nu$ | $1$               | $0.63 \pm 0.001$  |

In fact the space dimension is one of a small set of qualitative
features of a critical system which are sufficiently deep-seated to
survive coarse graining and which together serve to define the system's
universal behaviour, or *universality class*. The constituents of this
set are not all identifiable *a priori*. They include the number of
components $n$ of the order parameter. Up to now, we have only
considered order parameters which are scalar (for a fluid the density,
for a magnet the magnetisation), for which $n=1$. In some ferromagnets,
the order parameter may have components along two axes, or three axes,
implying a vector order parameter, with $n=2$ (the solcalled XY model) or $n=3$ (Heisenberg model), respectively. It
is clear that the order-parameter $n$-value will be reflected in the
nature of the coarse-grained configurations, and thus in the universal
observables they imply.

A third important feature which can change the universality class of a
critical system is the range of the interaction potential between its
constituent particles. Clearly for the Ising model, interactions between
spins are inherently nearest neighbour in character. Most fluids
interact via dispersion forces (such as the Lennard-Jones potential)
which is also short ranged owing to the $r^{-6}$ attractive interaction.
However some systems have much longer ranged interactions. Notable here
are systems of charged particles which interact via a Coulomb potential.
The long ranged nature of the Coulomb potential (which decays like
$r^{-1}$) means that charged systems often do not have the same critical
exponents as the Ising model and fluid.

## Critical exponents

We consider now how the critical exponents, may be computed via the
coarse-graining procedure. In what follows we will refer only to the
behaviour of a single typical coarse grained variable, which we shall
denote $S(L)$. We suppose that $t$ is sufficiently small that $\xi \gg
L_\textrm{ min}$. Universality and scaling may be expressed in the claim
that, for *any* $L$ and $t$, scale factors $a(L)$ and $b(L)$ may be
found such that the probability distribution $p(S(L),t)$ can be written
in the form

$$
p(S(L),t)=b(L)\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)
$${#eq-blocks}
where $\tilde{p}$ is a function unique to a universality class. 
The role of the scale factors $a$ and $b$ is to
absorb the basic non-universal scales identified in
@sec-rgmethod. The critical exponents are implicit in the
$L$-dependence of these scale factors. Specifically one finds:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a(L) & =a_0L^{1/\nu} \\
b(L) & =b_0L^{\beta/\nu}
\end{aligned} 
$${#eq-scalefacs}
where the amplitudes $a_0$ and $b_0$ are system specific (non-universal) constants.

These results state that the critical exponents (in the form $1/\nu$ and
$\beta/\nu$) characterize the ways in which the configuration spectrum
evolves under coarse-graining. Consider, first the exponent ratio
$\beta/\nu$. Precisely at the critical point, there is only one way in
which the coarse-grained configurations change with $L$: the overall
scale of the coarse-grained variable (the black-white contrast in our
grey scale representation) is eroded with increasing $L$. Thus the
configurations of coarse-graining length $L_1$ match those of a larger
coarse-graining length $L_2$ only if the variable scale in the latter
configurations is amplified. The required amplification follows from
@eq-blocks and and @eq-scalefacs: it is

$$
\frac{b(L_2)}{b(L_1)}=\left(\frac{L_2}{L_1}\right)^{\beta/\nu}\:.
$$
The exponent ratio $\beta/\nu$ thus controls the rate at which the scale
of the ordering variable decays with increasing coarse-graining length.

Consider now the exponent $1/\nu$. For small but non-zero reduced
temperature (large but finite $\xi$) there is second way in which the
configuration spectrum evolves with $L$. As noted previously, coarse
graining reduces the ratio of correlation length to coarse-graining
length, and results in configurations with a less critical appearance.
More precisely, we see from @eq-blocks that increasing the coarse graining length from
$L_1$ to $L_2$ while keeping the reduced temperature constant has the
same effect on the configuration spectrum as keeping coarse-graining
length constant which amplifying the reduced temperature $t$ by a factor

$$
\frac{a(L_2)}{a(L_1)}=\left(\frac{L_2}{L_1}\right)^{1/\nu}\:.
$$ One
may think of the combination $a(L)t$ as a measure of the effective
reduced temperature of the physical system viewed with resolution length
$L$. The exponent $1/\nu$ controls the rate at which the effective
reduced temperature flows with increasing coarse-graining length.

## Finite-size scaling {#sec-fss}

We can exploit the fact that the scale factors $a(L)$ and $b(L)$ depend
on critical exponents to estimate the values of these exponents using
computer simulation. Consider the average of the block variable $S(L)$.
Consideration of @eq-blkvar shows that this is non other than the value of
the order parameter $Q$, measured over a block of side $L$. Thus from
the definition of an average

$$
Q(L,t)=\bar {S}(L,t)=\int S(L)p(S(L),t)dS(L)
$$ where $p(S(L))$ is the
probability distribution of $S(L)$.

Making use of the representation of @eq-blocks, we then have that

$$Q
(L,t) = \int b(L)S(L)\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)dS(L)
$$

To integrate this we need to change the integration variable from $S(L)$
to $b(L)S(L)$. We have $d(b(L)S(L))=b(L)dS(L)$ since $b(L)$ does not
fluctuate. Thus
$$
\begin{aligned}
Q(L,t)  & =  b^{-1}(L)\int b(L)S(L)\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)d(b(L)S(L))\nonumber\\
        & =  b^{-1}(L)f(a(L)t)\nonumber\\
       & =  b_0L^{-\beta/\nu}f(a_0L^{1/\nu}t)
\end{aligned}
$$

where $f$ is a universal function (defined as the first
moment of $\tilde{p}(x,y)$ with respect to $y$).

The above results provide a method for determining the critical exponent
ratios $\beta/\nu$ and $1/\nu$ via computer simulations of near critical
systems. For instance, at the critical point ($t=0$) and for finite
block size, $Q(L,0)$ will not be zero (the $T$ at which Q vanishes for
finite $L$ is above the true $T_c$, cf. @sec-compsim.
However, we know that its value must vanish in the limit of infinite
$L$; it does so like

$$Q(L,0)=b_0L^{-\beta/\nu}f(0)\equiv Q_0L^{-\beta/\nu}$$

Thus by studying the critical point $L$ dependence of $Q$ we can
estimate $\beta/\nu$. A similar approach in which we study two block
sizes $L$, and tune $t$ separately in each case so that the results for
$QL^{\beta/\nu}$ are identical provides information on the value of
$1/\nu$.

## Summary of main points
As this is quite a long chapter let us summarise the main points: 


- **Limitations of conventional theories**: Mean field theories and the scaling hypothesis are insufficient in the critical region due to their neglect of correlations across all relevant length scales.

- **Critical region characteristics**: Near-critical systems exhibit correlated microstructure on all length scales up to the correlation length. The complexity of this structure makes both analytical and computational study challenging.

- **Relevant length scales**:
  1. Correlation length ($\xi$)
  2. Minimum microscopic scale ($L_\textrm{min}$)
  3. Macroscopic system size ($L_\textrm{max}$)

- **Window Condition for criticality**: The true critical regime satisfies $L_\textrm{max} \gg \xi \gg L_\textrm{min}$, encompassing a broad range of scales where complex, often fractal-like, structures are present.

- **Renormalisation Group (RG) methodology**: RG involves the stepwise elimination of degrees of freedom by coarse-graining the system over increasing length scales. A fourth scale, $L$, represents the resolution at which the system is described.

- **Effect of coarse-graining**: Coarse-graining changes the effective reduced temperature, captured by the relation $a(L)t$, where $a(L)$ scales with $L$ as $L^{1/\nu}$. This helps describe how critical configurations evolve with resolution.

- **Universality**:
  - Coarse-graining reveals that microscopically different systems can exhibit identical critical behavior when observed at large scales.
  - The concept of universality explains why disparate systems, such as magnets and fluids, can show the same critical exponents and scaling laws.
  - Critical behavior depends primarily on general features like dimensionality and symmetry, rather than microscopic details.


- **Finite-Size scaling**:
  - The average block variable $Q(L,t)$ is related to block size $L$ and reduced temperature $t$ through scaling relations. Computer simulations exploit this to extract scaling functions and the values of critical exponents. 
    

## Addendum: The effective coupling viewpoint of the renormalization group (non examinable) 

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Notes for those interested in a different perspective on RG theory.

Let us begin by returning to our fundamental @eq-probs,
which we rewrite as

$$p = Z^{-1}e^{-{\cal H}}$$ where ${\cal H}\equiv E/k_BT$.

The first step is then to imagine that we generate, by a computer
simulation procedure for example, a sequence of configurations with
relative probability $\exp(-{\cal H})$. We next adopt some
coarse-graining procedure which produces from these original
configurations a set of coarse-grained configurations. We then ask the
question: what is the energy function ${\cal H}^\prime$ of the
coarse-grained variables which would produce these coarse-grained
configurations with the correct relative probability
$\exp(-{\cal H}^\prime)$? Clearly the form of ${\cal H}^\prime$ depends
on the form of ${\cal H}$ thus we can write symbolically

$${\cal H}^\prime=R({\cal H})$$

The operation $R$, which defines the coarse-grained configurational
energy in terms of the microscopic configurational energy function is
known as a renormalisation group transformation (RGT). What it does is
to replace a hard problem by a less hard problem. Specifically, suppose
that our system is near a critical point and that we wish to calculate
its large-distance properties. If we address this task by utilizing the
configurational energy and appealing to the basic machinery of
statistical mechanics set out in @eq-probs and @eq-partition, the problem is hard. It is hard because the
system has fluctuations on all the (many) length scales intermediate
between the correlation length $\xi$ and the minimum length scale
$L_\textrm{min}$.

However, the task may instead be addressed by tackling the
coarse-grained system described by the energy ${\cal H}^\prime$. The
large-distance properties of this system are the same as the
large-distance properties of the physical system, since coarse-graining
operation preserves large-scale configurational structure. In this
representation the problem is a little easier: while the $\xi$
associated with ${\cal H}^\prime$ is the same as the $\xi$ associated
with ${\cal H}$, the minimum length scale of ${\cal H}^\prime$ is bigger
than that of ${\cal H}$. Thus the statistical mechanics of
${\cal H}^\prime$ poses a not-quite-so-many-length-scale problem, a
problem which is effectively a little less critical and is thus a little
easier to solve. The benefits accruing from this procedure may be
amplified by repeating it. Repeated application of $R$ will eventually
result in a coarse- grained energy function describing configurations in
which the $\xi$ is no bigger than the minimum length scale. The
associated system is far from criticality and its properties may be
reliably computed by any of a wide variety of approximation schemes.
These properties are the desired large-distance properties of the
physical system. As explicit reference to fluctuations of a given scale
is eliminated by coarse-graining, their effects are carried forward
implicitly in the parameters of the coarse-grained energy.

In order to setup the framework for a simple illustrative example, let
is return to the lattice Ising model for which the energy function
depended only on the product of nearest neighbour spins. The coefficient
of this product in the energy is the exchange coupling, $J$. In
principle, however, other kinds of interactions are also allowed; for
example, we may have a product of second neighbour spins with strength
$J_2$ or, perhaps, a product of four spins (at sites forming a square
whose side is the lattice spacing), with strength $J_3$. Such
interactions in a real magnet have their origin in the quantum mechanics
of the atoms and electrons and clearly depend upon the details of the
system. For generality therefore we will allow a family of exchange
couplings $J_1$,$J_2$,$J_3,\dots$, or $J_a, a =
1,2,\dots$ In reduced units, the equivalent coupling strengths are
$K_a =J_a/k_BT$. Their values determine uniquely the energy for any
given configuration.
    
> We note that it is not only useful to allow for arbitrary kinds of interactions: if we wish to repeat the transformation several
(indeed many) times, it is also necessary because even if we start with only the nearest neighbour coupling in ${\cal H}$ the transformation will in general produce others in ${\cal H}^\prime$.

Now consider the coarse-graining procedure. Let us suppose that this
procedure takes the form of a 'majority rule' operation in which the new
spins are assigned values $+1$ or $-1$ according to the signs of the
magnetic moments of the blocks with which they are associated. The new
energy function ${\cal H}^\prime$ will be expressible in terms of some
new coupling strengths $K^\prime$ describing the interactions amongst
the new spin variables (and thus, in effect, the interactions between
blocks of the original spin variables). The RGT simply states that these
new couplings depend on the old couplings: $K_1^\prime$ is some function
$f_1$ of all the original couplings, and generally

$$K^\prime_a=f_a(K_1,K_2,\dots) =f_a(\mathbf {K}),\quad a= 1, 2,\dots
$${#eq-rgt} where **K** is shorthand for the set $K_1, K_2,\dots$

### A simple example

This example illustrates how one can perform the RG transformation @eq-rgt
directly, without recourse to a 'sequence of typical configurations'.
The calculation involves a very crude approximation which has the
advantage that it simplifies the subsequent analysis.

![Coarse graining by decimation. The spins on the original lattice are
divided into two sets $\{s^\prime\}$ and $\{\tilde{s}\}$. The
$\{s^\prime\}$ spins occupy a lattice whose spacing is twice that of the
original. The effective coupling interaction between the $\{s^\prime\}$
spins is obtained by performing the configurational average over the
$\{\tilde{s}\}$ ](Figs/rglat.png){#fig-rglat width=40%}

Consider an Ising model in two dimensions, with only nearest neighbour
interactions as shown in @fig-rglat. We have divided the spins into two sets, the
spins $\{s^\prime\}$ form a square lattice of spacing $2$, the others
being denoted by $\{\tilde{s}\}$. One then defines an effective energy
function ${\cal H^\prime}$ for the $s^\prime$ spins by performing an
average over all the possible arrangements of the $\tilde{s}$ spins

$$
\exp(-{\cal H}^\prime)=\sum_{\{\tilde {s}\}} \exp(-{\cal H}).
$${#eq-decimate}

This particular coarse-graining scheme is called 'decimation' because a
certain fraction (not necessarily one-tenth!) of spins on the lattice is
eliminated. This formulation of a new energy function realizes two basic
aims of the RG method: the long-distance physics of the 'original'
system, described by ${\cal H}$, is contained in that of the 'new'
system, described by ${\cal H}^\prime$ (indeed the partition functions
are the same as one can see by summing both sides over $s^\prime$) and
the new system is further from critically because the ratio of $\xi$ to
lattice spacing ('minimum length scale') has been reduced by a factor of
$1/2$ (the ratio of the lattice spacings of the two systems). We must
now face the question of how to perform the configuration sum in @eq-decimate. This cannot in general be done exactly, so we
must resort to some approximation scheme. The particular approximation
which we invoke is the high temperature series expansion. In its simplest mathematical form, since
${\cal H}$ contains a factor $1/k_BT$, it involves the expansion of
$\exp(-{\cal H})$ as a power series:

$$\exp(-{\cal H}/k_BT)=1-{\cal H}/k_BT +\frac{1}{2!}({\cal H}/k_BT)^2+.....$$

We substitute this expansion into the right hand side of @eq-decimate
and proceed to look for terms which depend on
the $s^\prime$ spins after the sum over the possible arrangements of the
$\tilde{s}$ spins is performed. This sum extends over all the possible
($\pm 1$) values of all the $\tilde{s}$ spins. The first term (the 1) in
the expansion of the exponential is clearly independent of the values of
the $s^\prime$ spins. The second term (${\cal H}$) is a function of the
$s^\prime$ spins, but gives zero when the sum over the $s^\prime$ spins
is performed because only a single factor of any $s^\prime$ ever
appears, and $+ 1 - 1 = 0$. The third term (${\cal H}^2/2$) does
contribute. If one writes out explicitly the form of ${\cal H}^2/2$ one
finds terms of the form
$K^2s_1^\prime\tilde{s}\tilde{s}s_2^\prime=K^2s_1^\prime s_2^\prime$,
where $s_1^\prime$ and $s_2^\prime$ denote two spins at nearest
neighbour sites on the lattice of $s^\prime$ spins and $\tilde{s}$ is
the spin (in the other set) which lies between them. Now, in the
corresponding expansion of the left hand side of @eq-decimate, we find terms of the form
$K^\prime s_1^\prime s_2^\prime$, where $K^\prime$ is the nearest
neighbour coupling for the $s^\prime$ spins. We conclude (with a little
more thought than we detail here) that

$$
K^\prime=K^2
$${#eq-rgdec}

Of course many other terms and couplings are generated by the higher
orders of the high temperature expansion and it is necssary to include
these if one wishes reliable values for the critical temperature and
exponents, However, our aim here is to use this simple calculation to
illustrate the RG method. Let us therefore close our eyes, forget about
the higher order terms and show how the RGT @eq-rgdec can be used to obtain information on the phase
transition.

![Coupling flow under the decimation transformation described in the text.](Figs/flow1.png){#fig-flow1 width=60%}

The first point to note is that that mathematically @eq-rgdec
has the fixed point $K^*= 1$; if $K= 1$ then the new effective coupling
$K^\prime$ has the same value $1$. Further, if $K$ is just larger than
$1$, then $K^\prime$ is larger than $K$, i.e. further away from $1$.
Similarly, if $K$ is less than $1$, $K^\prime$ is less than $K$. We say
that the fixed point is unstable: the flow of couplings under repeated
iteration of @eq-rgdec is away from the fixed point, as illustrated in
@fig-flow1. The physical significance of this is as follows: suppose that the original
system is at its critical point so that the ratio of $\xi$ to lattice
spacing is infinite. After one application of the decimation
transformation, the effective lattice spacing has increased by a factor
of two, but this ratio remains infinite; the new system is therefore
also at its critical point. Within the approximations inherent in
@eq-rgdec, the original system is an Ising model with
nearest neighbour coupling $K$ and the new system is an Ising model with
nearest neighbour coupling $K^\prime$. If these two systems are going to
be at a common critically, we must identify $K^\prime=
K$. The fixed point $K^*= 1$ is therefore a candidate for the critical
point $K_c$, where the phase transition occurs. This interpretation is
reinforced by considering the case where the original system is close
to, but not at, criticality. Then $\xi$ is finite and the new system is
further from critically because the ratio of $\xi$ to lattice spacing is
reduced by a factor of two. This instability of a fixed point to
deviations of $K$ from $K^*$ is a further necessary condition for its
interpretation as a critical point of the system. In summary then we
make the prediction

$$
K_c=J/k_BT_c=1
$${#eq-Kc}

We can obtain further information about the behaviour of the system
close to its critical point. In order to do so, we rewrite the 
transformation (@eq-rgdec) in terms of the deviation of the coupling from
its fixed point value. A Taylor expansion of the function $K^\prime=K^2$
yields

$$
\begin{aligned}
K^\prime =& (K^*)^2 +(K-K^*)\left.\frac{\partial K^\prime}{\partial K}\right|_{K=K^*}+\frac{1}{2}(K-K^*)^2\left.\frac{\partial^2 K^\prime}{\partial K^2}\right|_{K=K^*}+\ldots\nonumber\\
K^\prime - K^* =& 2 (K - K^*)+ (K - K^*)^2 
\end{aligned}
$$

 where in the second line we have used the fact that the
first derivative evaluates to $2K^*=2$ and $(K^*)^2=K^*$.

For a system sufficiently close to its critical temperature the final
term can be neglected. The deviation of the coupling from its fixed
point (critical) value is thus bigger for the new system than it is for
the old by a factor of two. This means that the reduced temperature is
also bigger by a factor of two:

$$t^\prime= 2t$$

But $\xi$ (in units of the appropriate lattice spacing) is smaller by a
factor of $1/2$:

$$\xi^\prime= \xi/2$$

Thus, when we double $t$, we halve $\xi$, implying that

$$\xi\propto t^{-1}$$

for $T$ close to $T_c$. Thus we see that the RGT predicts scaling
behaviour with calculable critical exponents. In this simple calculation
we estimate the critical exponent $\nu=1$ for the square lattice Ising
model. This prediction is actually in agreement with the exactly
established value. The agreement is fortuitous- the prediction in
Eq. refeq:Kc for $K_c$, is larger than the exactly established value by
a factor of more than two. In order to obtain reliable estimates more
sophisticated and systematic methods must be used.

The crude approximation in the calculation above produced a
transformation, @eq-rgdec, involving only the nearest neighbour coupling,
with the subsequent advantages of simple algebra. We pay a penalty for
this simplicity in two ways: the results obtained for critical
properties are in rather poor agreement with accepted values, and we
gain no insight into the origin of universality.

### Universality and scaling

In order to expose how universality can arise, we should from the start
allow for several different kinds of coupling $J_a$, and show how the
systems with *different* $J_a$ can have the *same* critical behaviour.

![General flow in coupling space](Figs/flow2.png){#fig-flow2 width=80%}

@fig-flow2 is a representation of the space of all coupling strengths $K_a$ in the
energy function ${\cal H}/k_BT$. This is of course actually a space of
infinite dimension, but representing three of these, as we have done,
enables us to illustrate all the important aspects. First let us be
clear what the points in this space represent. Suppose we have some
magnetic material which is described by a given set of exchange
constants $J_1,J_2,J_3.....$ As the temperature $T$ varies, the coupling
strengths $K_a=J_a/k_BT$ trace out a straight line, or ray, from the
origin of the space in the direction ($J_1,J_2,J_3 ....$ ). Points on
this ray close to the origin represent this magnet at high temperatures,
and conversely points far from the origin represent the magnet at low
temperatures. The critical point of the magnet is represented by a
specific point on this ray, $K_a=
J_a/k_BT, a= 1,2,\dots$ The set of critical points on all of the
possible rays forms a *surface*, the critical surface. Formally, it is
defined by the set of all possible models (of the Ising type) which have
infinite $\xi$. It is shown schematically as the shaded surface in
@fig-flow2. (In the figure it is a two-dimensional surface; more generally it has one
dimension less than the full coupling constant space, dividing all
models into high and low temperature phases.)

Our immediate goal then is to understand how the RGT can explain why
different physical systems near this critical surface have the same
behaviour. Let us turn now to the schematic representation of the RG
flow in @fig-flow2. Suppose we start with a physical system, with
coupling strengths $K_a,  a= 1,2, \dots$. What the RGT does is generate
a new point in the figure, at the coupling strengths
$K_a^{(1)}=f_a(\mathbf {K})$; these are the couplings appearing in the
effective energy function describing the coarse-grained system. If we
repeat the transformation, the new energy function has coupling
strengths $K_a^{(2)}=f_a(\mathbf {K})$. Thus repeated application of the
transformation generates a flow of points in the figure: $\mathbf{K}\to
K^{(1)}\to\dots\to K^{(n)}$ where the superscript ($n$) labels the
effective couplings after $n$ coarse-graining steps. if the change in
coarse-graining scale is $b$ ($> 1$) at each step, the total change in
coarse-graining scale is $b^n$ after $n$ steps. In the process,
therefore, the ratio of $\xi$ to coarse-graining scale is reduced by a
factor of $b^{-n}$. The dots in @fig-flow2
identify three lines of RG flow starting from three systems differing
only in their temperature. (The flow lines are schematic but display the
essential features revealed in detailed calculations.)

Consider first the red dots which start from the nearest neighbour Ising
model at its critical point. The ratio of $\xi$ to coarse-graining scale
is reduced by a factor b at each step, but, since it starts infinite, it
remains infinite after any finite number of steps. In this case we can
in principle generate an unbounded number of dots,
$\mathbf{ K^{(1)}, K^{(2)},\dots,K^{(n)}}$, all of which lie in the critical
surface. The simplest behaviour of such a sequence as $n$ increases is
to tend to a limit, $K^*$, say. In such a case

$$K^*_a=f_a(K^*)~~~~ a= 1,2 .....$$

This point $\mathbf{K^*} \equiv K_1^*, K_2^*, \dots$ is therefore a *fixed
point* which lies in the critical surface.

By contrast, consider the same magnet as before, now at temperature $T$
just greater than $T_c$, its couplings $K_a$, will be close to the first
red dot (in fact they will be slightly smaller) and so will the
effective couplings $K_a^{(1)},K_2^{(2)},\dots$ of the corresponding
coarse-grained systems. The new flow will therefore appear initially to
follow the red dots towards the same fixed point. However, the flow must
eventually move away from the fixed point because each coarse-graining
now produces a model further from criticality. The resulting flow is
represented schematically by one set of black dots. The other set of
black dots shows the expected flow starting from the same magnet
slightly below its critical temperature.

We are now in a position to understand both universality and scaling
within this framework. We will suppose that there exists a single fixed
point in the critical surface which sucks in all flows starting from a
point in that surface. Then any system at its critical point will
exhibit large-length scale physics (large-block spin behaviour)
described by the single set of fixed point coupling constants. The
uniqueness of this limiting set of coupling constants is the essence of
critical point universality. It is, of course, the algebraic counterpart
of the unique limiting spectrum of coarse-grained configurations,
discussed in @sec-unipics. Similarly the scale-invariance of the critical
point configuration spectrum (viewed on large enough length scales) is
expressed in the invariance of the couplings under iteration of the
transformation (after a number of iterations large enough to secure
convergence to the fixed point).

To understand the behaviour of systems near but not precisely at
critically we must make a further assumption (again widely justified by
explicit studies). The flow line stemming from any such system will, we
have argued, be borne towards the fixed point before ultimately
deviating from it after a number of iterations large enough to expose
the system's noncritical character. We assume that (as indicated
schematically in the streams of red and blue lines in @fig-flow2
the deviations lie along a single line through the fixed point, the
direction followed along this line differing according to the sign of
the temperature deviation $T-T_c$. Since any two sets of coupling
constants on the line (on the same side of the fixed point) are related
by a suitable coarse-graining operation, this picture implies that the
large-length-scale physics of all near- critical systems differs only in
the matter of a length scale. This is the essence of near-critical point
universality.
