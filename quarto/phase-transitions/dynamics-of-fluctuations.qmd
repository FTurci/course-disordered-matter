# Dynamics of Fluctuations

*This section is here for your interest but is not considered examinable.*

In equilibrium, the principle of **detailed balance** implies microscopic reversibility — there are no net probability currents. As a result, time evolution is symmetric: fluctuations are time-reversal invariant. 
Recall the dynamic correlation matrix introduced in @sec-correlations
$$
\langle x(\tau) y(\tau + t) \rangle = M_{xy}(t)
$$

of which $M_{xx}(t)$ is the diagonal.

Therefore:

$$
M_{xx}(t) = \langle x(\tau) x(\tau + t) \rangle = \langle x(\tau) x(\tau - t) \rangle = M_{xx}(-t)
$$

For the cross-correlation $M_{xy}$, we have:

$$
M_{xy}(-t) = \langle y(\tau - t) x(\tau) \rangle = \langle y(\tau) x(\tau + t) \rangle
$$

(using time translation invariance of the equilibrium state). Combining this with the previous symmetry, we find:

$$
M_{xy}(t) = M_{yx}(t)
$$

This means the dynamic correlation matrix is symmetric in its indices — a non-trivial consequence of microscopic time-reversal symmetry.

## Linear Response Theory and the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem

Now suppose we gently perturb the system. For example, we might apply a small thermodynamic force $f_x$ that couples to a fluctuating variable $x$ — like a weak magnetic field $h$ acting on a local magnetization.

(Formally, this means adding a perturbation $-f_x x$ to the Hamiltonian.)

A typical experimental protocol applies the perturbation from $t = -\infty$ and switches it off at $t = 0$. For $t > 0$, the average response of another variable $y$ is observed to decay:

$$
\langle y(t) \rangle_f = R_{yx}(t) \, f_x
$$

Here, $R_{yx}(t)$ is the **response function** describing how $y$ responds to a small force applied to $x$ at earlier times (for $t \geq 0$).

The key idea is this: If the perturbation is small enough, its effects are indistinguishable from those of a spontaneous fluctuation. So, the decay of the response function should mirror the decay of the correlation function of naturally occurring fluctuations.

This is the essence of the **fluctuation-dissipation theorem**:

$$
k_B T \, R_{yx}(t) = M_{yx}(t)
$$

This powerful result says that the system's response to a small disturbance is directly related to the correlation of fluctuations in thermal equilibrium.

The factor $k_B T$ ensures both sides of the equation have the same physical dimensions.

> *Note:* We skip the full proof, which requires formal machinery from classical mechanics (e.g., Poisson brackets) or quantum mechanics (density matrices). For more, see the final chapter of Chandler.


## Onsager's Theorem

Now, recall from the previous section that the correlation matrix is symmetric:

$$
M_{xy}(t) = M_{yx}(t)
$$

Combining this with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem gives:

$$
R_{xy}(t) = R_{yx}(t)
$$

This result is known as **Onsager's reciprocal relation**. It states that the response of variable $x$ to a force acting on $y$ is the same as the response of $y$ to a force acting on $x$ — provided the system is in equilibrium.

This is a deep and subtle consequence of microscopic reversibility, and Onsager's real contribution was realizing such a connection could exist. 
(Onsager also solved the 2D Ising model analytically and won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1968.)
