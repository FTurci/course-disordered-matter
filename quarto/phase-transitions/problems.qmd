# Phase transitions: Problems

Although you should try all of these questions, some of them are
deliberately quite challenging. If you don't get very far with some,
don't worry. We'll be going over them in problems classes, so you can
just regard them as worked examples.

1.  **Existence of a phase transition in $d=2$.**

    (Straightforward) In lectures it was argued that no long ranged
    order occurs at finite-temperatures in a one dimensional system
    because of the presence of domain walls. Were macroscopic domain
    walls to exist in two dimensions at finite temperature, they would
    similarly destroy long ranged order and prevent a phase transition.
    By calculating the free energy of a 2D domain wall for an Ising
    lattice, show that domain walls do not in fact exist for
    sufficiently low $T$.

    (*Hint: Model the domain wall as a non-reversing $N$-step random
    walk on the lattice and find an expression for its energy and -from
    the number of random walk configurations- its entropy.*)

2.  **Correlation Length**

    (Challenging) For a 1D Ising model, show that the correlation
    between the spins at sites $i$ and $j$, is

    $$\langle s_i s_j\rangle =\sum_m p_m(-1)^m$$ where $m$ is the number
    of domain walls between $i$ and $j$ and $p_m$ is the probability of
    finding $m$ domain walls between them.

    Hence show that when $R_{ij}=|i-j|a$ is large (with $a$ the lattice
    spacing) and the temperature is small, that

    $$\langle s_i s_j\rangle =\exp(-R_{ij}/\xi)$$ with $\xi=a/2p$ and
    $p$ the probability of finding a domain wall on a bond.

    *Hint: In the second part note that $p_m$ is given by a binomial
    distribution because there is a probability $p$ of each bond
    containing a domain wall and $(1-p)$ that it doesn't. What special
    type of distribution does $p_m$ tend to when $p$ is small (as occurs
    at low $T$)?*

3.  **A model fluid**

    (Straightforward) The van der Waals (vdW) equation of state (recall
    PH10002) is essentially a mean field theory for fluids. It relates
    the pressure and the volume of a fluid to the temperature:

    $$\left(P+\frac{a}{V^2}\right)(V-b)=N_Ak_BT$$ where $a$ and $b$ are
    constants and $N_A$ is Avogadro's number.

    The critical point of a fluid corresponds to the point at which the
    isothermal compressibility diverges, that is

    $$\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_T=0$$ Additionally, one
    finds that isotherms of $P$ versus $V$ exhibit a point of inflection
    at the critical point, that is

    $$\left(\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial V^2}\right)_T=0$$

    - Use these two requirements to show that the critical point of the
      vdW fluid is located at

      $$V_c=3b, ~~~ P_c=\frac{a}{27b^2},~~~ N_AK_BT_c=\frac{8a}{27b}$$

    - Hence show that when written in terms of reduced variables

      $$p=\frac{P}{P_c}, ~~~~ v=\frac{V}{V_c} ~~~~ t=\frac{T}{T_c}$$

      the equation takes the form

      $$\left(p+\frac{3}{v^2}\right)(v-\frac{1}{3})=\frac{8t}{3}$$

    - Use a graph-plotting program such as "Excel" to plot a selection
      of isotherms close to the critical temperature (you will need to
      choose suitable units for your axes). Plot also the gradient and
      second derivative of P vs V on the critical isotherm and confirm
      numerically that it exhibits a point of inflection at the critical
      pressure and temperature.

    - Obtain the value of the critical exponent $\gamma$ of the vdW
      model and confirm that it takes a mean-field value.

4.  **Mean field theory of the Ising model heat capacity**

    (Straightforward) Using results derived in lectures, obtain an
    expression for the mean energy $\langle E\rangle$ of the Ising model
    in zero field, within the simplest mean field approximation $\langle
      s_is_j\rangle=\langle s_i\rangle\langle s_j\rangle=m^2$. Hence
    show that for $H=0$ the heat capacity $\partial \langle
      E\rangle/\partial T$ has the behaviour

    \begin{aligned}
    C_H=& 0 ~~~~ T>T_c\\
    C_H=& 3Nk_B/2 ~~~~ T\le T_c
    \end{aligned}

5.  **Magnetisation and fluctuations**

    (Slightly tricky) A system of spins on a lattice, has, in the
    absence of an applied field, a Hamiltonian ${\cal H}$. In the
    presence of a field $h$ the Hamiltonian becomes
    $$\tilde {\cal H}={\cal H}-hM$$ where $M$ is the total magnetisation
    and $h$ is the magnetic field. By considering the partition function
    $Z(T,h)$ and its relationship to the free energy $F$ show that in
    general

    $$\langle M \rangle=-\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial h}\right)_T$$

    Show also that the variance of the magnetisation fluctuations is

    $$\langle M^2\rangle-\langle M\rangle^2=-k_BT\left(\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial h^2}\right)_T$$

    (*Hint: This is an important standard derivation found in many text
    books on Statistical Mechanics. You will need to differentiate $F$
    (twice) and use the product and chain rules.*)

6.  **Spin-1 Ising model**

    (Straightforward) A set of spins on a lattice of coordination number
    $q$ can take values $(-1,0,1)$, as opposed to just $(-1,1)$ as in
    the spin-1/2 Ising model. The Hamiltonian is

    $${\cal H}=-J\sum_{<ij>}s_is_j + h\sum_i s_i$$

    Find the partition function and hence show that in the mean field
    approximation, the magnetisation per site obeys

    $$m=\frac{2\sinh[\beta(Jqm+h)]}{2\cosh[\beta(Jqm+h)]+1}$$

    and find the critical temperature $T_c$ at which the net
    magnetisation vanishes.

7.  **Transfer Matrix.**

    (Straightforward strategy but some lengthy algebra required)

    Verify the calculation of the free energy of the 1D periodic chain
    Ising model in a field outlined in lectures using the Transfer
    Matrix method.

    Use your results to show that the spontaneous magnetisation is:

    $$m=\frac{\sinh \beta H}{\sqrt{\sinh^2\beta H+\exp{-4\beta J}}}$$
    Comment on the value of $m$ in zero field.

    (*Hint: Follow the prescription given in lectures. Depending on your
    approach you may need to use the trigonometrical identities
    $\cosh^2x-\sinh^2x=1$, $\cosh(2x)=2\cosh^2x-1$.*)

8.  **Lattice gas model** (Straightforward). Check the claim, made in
    lectures that the "Hamiltonian" of the Lattice Gas model in the
    grand canonical ensemble

    $${\cal H}_{LG}=-\epsilon\sum_{<i,j>}c_ic_j -\mu\sum_ic_i$$

    is transformed to that of the Ising model by means of the change of
    variable

    $$s_i=2c_i-1;~~~~ J=\frac{\epsilon}{4}~~~~
    h=\frac{\epsilon q+2\mu}{4}$$

    (*Hint: Note that when doing sums over bonds $\sum_{\langle
        i,j\rangle}$ for a lattice of coordination $q$ there are $q/2$
    bonds per site since each bond is shared between two sites.*)

9.  **Landau theory**

    Check and complete the Landau theory calculations, given in
    lectures, for the critical exponents $\gamma=1$ and $\alpha=0$ of
    the Ising model. For the latter, you should first prove the result

    $$C_H =-T\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial T^2}$$ starting from the
    classical theormodynamics expression for changes in the free energy
    of a magnet $dF=-SdT-MdH$.

    (*Hint: If you get stuck with the proof see standard thermodynamics
    text books. To get the susceptibility exponent in Landau theory add
    a term $-Hm$ to the Hamiltonian.*)

10. **Scaling laws**

    (Straightforward.)Using the generalised homogeneous form for the
    free energy given in lectures, take appropriate derivatives to find
    the relationships to the critical exponents:

    $$\beta=\frac{1-b}{a}; ~~ \gamma=\frac{2b-1}{a};~~ \delta= \frac{b}{1-b}; ~~~ \alpha=2-\frac{1}{a}.$$

    Hence derive the scaling laws among the critical exponents:

    \begin{aligned}
    \alpha+\beta(\delta+1)=2 \\
    \alpha+2\beta+\gamma=2\\
    %\gamma=\beta(\delta-1)
    \end{aligned} (*Hint: For the heat capacity exponent $\alpha$ use
    the result from problem 9:
    $C_H=-T\left(\frac{\partial^2F}{\partial T^2}\right)_{h=0}$*)

11. **Renormalization Group transformation for the 1D Ising model**

    (Challenging.) Consider a 1D Ising model of $N$ spins in zero field
    given by the Hamiltonian

    $${\cal H}_I/k_BT=-K\sum_{<ij>}s_is_j -\sum_iC$$ where a background
    term is included because even if set zero initially, it will be
    generated by an RG transformation.

    - A renormalisation is to be implemented with a scale factor $b=2$.
      By partially performing the sum in the partition function over the
      spins on the even numbered lattice sites, show that the partially
      summed partition function can be written

      $$Z=\sum_{s_1,s_3,s_5...}\prod_{i=2,4,6...} [\exp
      [K(s_{i-1}+s_{i+1})+2C] + \exp[-K(s_{i-1}+s_{i+1})+2C]$$

    - Next, relabel the remaining (odd numbered) spins so that they are
      numbered consecutively eg by an index $j$ (this is a matter of
      convenience only). Then cast this partially summed partition
      function in a form that makes it look the same as that for an
      Ising model with $N/2$ spins. i.e. require that $Z^\prime$ has the
      form

      $$Z=\sum_{\{s\}}\prod_{j=1}^{N/2}\exp[K^\prime s_js_{j+1}+C^\prime]\:,$$
      for all $s_j,s_{j+1}=\pm 1$.

      Hence show that the effective coupling $K^\prime$, and background
      constant $C^\prime$ of the renormalised system are related to
      those of the underlying Hamiltonian by

      \begin{aligned}
      \exp(K^\prime+C^\prime) &=& \exp(2C)[\exp(2K)+\exp(-2K)] \\
      \exp(-K^\prime+C^\prime) &=& 2\exp(2C)
      \end{aligned}

    - Use these results to show that the effective coupling flows under
      the renormalization according to:

      $$K^\prime = (1/2)\ln (\cosh 2K)$$

      Does this flow drive the effective coupling to the low or high
      temperature fixed point?

    - Finally show that the partition function transforms under the RG
      as

      $$Z(K,N)=2^{N/2}\exp(NK^\prime/2)Z(K^\prime,N/2)$$

    *Note. The above is a hard question, which we'll go over this in
    detail in a problems class. So if you don't make much progress,
    don't worry, just treat it as a worked example.*

12. **RG flow of the free energy**

    (Straightforward) An alternative RG equation for the effective
    coupling in the 1D Ising model is

    $$K = (1/2)\cosh^{-1}(\exp 2K^\prime)$$ which is the inverse of the
    transformation found in the previous question. This transformation
    thus drives the system from small effective coupling (high
    temperature) to high effective coupling (low temperature).

    Under the transformation, the free energy density transforms like

    $$\beta f(K)=(1/2)\beta f(K^\prime)-(1/2)\ln 2-K^\prime/2\:.$$

    - Use these findings to iteratively calculate the free energy
      density of the Ising model at low temperatures, starting from the
      high temperature limit.

      *Hint: Start with a very low coupling eg. $K^\prime=0.01$, and
      show that because interactions between spins are negligible,
      $\beta f(K^\prime)\approx
      -\ln 2$. Then iterate the RG equations above $8$ or so times to
      generate a sequence of $K$ and $\beta f(K)$ values.*

    - Compare your results for each iteration with the exact results for
      the free energy density of the 1D Ising model obtained in
      lectures.
