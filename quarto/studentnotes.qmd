One motivation for supplying you with detailed printed notes for this
course is the absence of a wholly ideal text book. However, it should be
stressed that while these notes approach (in places) the detail of a
book, the notes are not fully comprehensive and should be regarded as
the 'bare bones' of the course, to be fleshed out via your own reading
and supplementary note taking. To this end perhaps the most appropriate
textbook is

# Introduction

A wide variety of physical systems undergo rearrangements of their
internal constituents in response to the thermodynamic conditions to
which they are subject. Two classic examples of systems displaying such
phase transitions are the ferromagnet and fluid systems. As the
temperature of a ferromagnet is increased, its magnetic moment is
observed to decrease smoothly, until at a certain temperature known as
the critical temperature, it vanishes altogether.

</figure>

Similarly, a change of state from liquid to gas can be induced in a
fluid system (though not in an ideal gas) simply by raising the
temperature. Typically the liquid-vapour transition is abrupt,
reflecting the large density difference between the states either side
of the transition. However the abruptness of this transition can be
reduced by applying pressure. At one particular pressure and temperature
the discontinuity in the density difference between the two states
vanishes. These conditions of pressure and temperature serve to locate
the critical point for the fluid.

</figure>

In the vicinity of a critical point a system will exhibit a variety of
remarkable effects known collectively as critical phenomena. Principal
among these effects is the divergence of thermal response functions such
as the specific heat and the fluid compressibility or magnetic
susceptibility. It transpires that the origin of the singularities in
these quantities can be traced to large-length-scale co-operative
effects between the microscopic constituents of the system. The
recalcitrant problem posed by the critical region is how best to
incorporate such collective effects within the framework of a rigorous
mathematical theory that affords both physical insight and quantitative
explanation of the observed phenomena. This matter has been (and still
is!) the subject of intense theoretical activity.

The importance of the critical point stems largely from the fact that
many of the phenomena observed in its vicinity are believed to be common
to a whole range of apparently quite disparate physical systems. Systems
such as liquid mixtures, superconductors, liquid crystals, ferromagnets,
antiferromagnets and molecular crystals may display identical behaviour
near criticality. This observation implies a profound underlying
similarity among physical systems at criticality, regardless of many
aspects of their distinctive microscopic nature. These ideas have found
formal expression in the so-called 'universality hypothesis' which,
since its inception some 35 years ago, has enjoyed considerable success.

In this course, principal aspects of the contemporary theoretical
viewpoint of phase transitions and critical phenomena will be reviewed.
Mean field theories of phase transitions will be discussed and their
inadequacies in the critical region will be exposed. The phenomenology
of the critical region will we described including power laws, critical
exponents and their relationship to scaling phenomena. These will be set
within the context of the powerful renormalisation group technique. The
notion of universality as a phenomenological hypothesis will be
introduced and its implications for real and model systems will be
explored. Finally, the utility of finite-size scaling methods for
computer studies of critical phenomena will be discussed, culminating in
the introduction of a specific technique suitable for exposing
universality in model systems.

# Background concepts {#sec:background}

In seeking to describe near-critical phenomena, it is useful to have a
quantitative measure of the difference between the phases coalescing at
the critical point: this is the role of the *order parameter*, $Q$. In
the case of the fluid, the order parameter is taken as the difference
between the densities of the liquid and vapour phases. In the
ferromagnet it is taken as the magnetisation. As its name suggest, the
order parameter serves as a measure of the kind of orderliness that sets
in when the temperature is cooled below a critical temperature.

Our first task is to give some feeling for the principles which underlie
the ordering process. The probability $p_a$ that a physical system at
temperature $T$ will have a particular microscopic arrangement
(configuration), labelled $a$, of energy $E_a$ is

$$p_a=\frac{1}{Z}e^{-E_a/k_BT}
\label{eq:probs}$$

The prefactor $Z^{-1}$ is the *partition function*: since the system
must always have *some* specific arrangement, the sum of the
probabilities $p_a$ must be unity, implying that

$$Z=\sum_ae^{-E_a/k_BT}
\label{eq:partition}$$ where the sum extends over all possible
microscopic arrangements.

These equations assume that physical system evolves rapidly (on the
timescale of typical observations) amongst all its allowed arrangements,
sampling them with the probabilities
eq. [\[eq:probs\]](#eq:probs){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:probs"}; the expectation value of any physical observable
$O$ will thus be given by averaging $O$ over all the arrangements $a$,
weighting each contribution by the appropriate probability:

$$\bar {O}=\frac{1}{Z}\sum_a O_a e^{-E_a/k_BT}
\label{eq:observable}$$

Sums like eq. [\[eq:observable\]](#eq:observable){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:observable"} are not easily evaluated. Nevertheless, some
important insights follow painlessly. Consider the case where the
observable of interest is the order parameter, or more specifically the
magnetisation of a ferromagnet.

$$Q=\frac{1}{Z}\sum_a Q_a e^{-E_a/k_BT}
\label{eq:op}$$

It is clear from eq. [\[eq:probs\]](#eq:probs){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:probs"} that at very low temperature the system will be
overwhelmingly likely to be found in its minimum energy arrangements
(ground states). For the ferromagnet, these are the fully ordered spin
arrangements having magnetisation $+1$, or $-1$.

Now consider the high temperature limit. The enhanced weight that the
fully ordered arrangement carries in the sum of
eq. [\[eq:op\]](#eq:op){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:op"} by
virtue of its low energy, is now no longer sufficient to offset the fact
that arrangements in which $Q_a$ has some intermediate value, though
each carry a smaller weight, are vastly greater in number. A little
thought shows that the arrangements which have essentially zero
magnetisation (equal populations of up and down spins) are by far the
most numerous. At high temperature, these disordered arrangements
dominate the sum in eq. [\[eq:op\]](#eq:op){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:op"} and the order parameter is zero.

The competition between energy-of-arrangements weighting (or simply
'energy') and the 'number of arrangements' weighting (or 'entropy') is
then the key principle at work here. The distinctive feature of a system
with a critical point is that, in the course of this competition, the
system is forced to choose amongst a number of macroscopically different
sets of microscopic arrangements.

Finally in this section, we note that the probabilistic (statistical
mechanics) approach to thermal systems outlined above is completely
compatible with classical thermodynamics. Specifically, the bridge
between the two disciplines is provided by the following equation

$$F=-k_BT \ln Z
\label{eq:free}$$ where $F$ is the "Helmholtz free energy". All
thermodynamic observables, for example the order parameter $Q$, and
response functions such as the specific heat or magnetic susceptibility
are obtainable as appropriate derivatives of the free energy. For
instance, utilizing
eq. [\[eq:partition\]](#eq:partition){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:partition"}, one can readily verify (try it as an
exercise!) that the average internal energy is given by

$$\bar{E}=-\frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta},$$ where
$\beta=(k_BT)^{-1}$.

The relationship between other thermodynamic quantities and derivatives
of the free energy are given in
fig. [3](#fig:thermo){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:thermo"}

thermodynamic observables.</figcaption>

# The Approach to Criticality

It is a matter of experimental fact that the approach to criticality in
a given system is characterized by the divergence of various
thermodynamic observables. Let us remain with the archetypal example of
a critical system, the ferromagnet, whose critical temperature will be
denoted as $T_c$. For temperatures close to $T_c$, the magnetic response
functions (the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ and the specific heat) are
found to be singular functions, diverging as a *power* of the reduced
(dimensionless) temperature $t \equiv
(T-T_c)/T_c$:-

$$\chi \equiv \frac{\partial M}{\partial H}\propto t^{-\gamma} ~~~~ (H=0) 
\label{eq:chipow}
\label{eq:sus}$$ (where $M=mN$),
$$C_H \equiv \frac{\partial E}{\partial T}\propto t^{-\alpha} ~~~~ (H=\textrm{ constant}) 
\label{eq:Cv}$$

Another key quantity is the correlation length $\xi$, which measures the
distance over which fluctuations of the magnetic moments are correlated.
This is observed to diverge near the critical point with an exponent
$\nu$.

$$\xi \propto t^{-\nu} ~~~~ (T > T_c,\: H=0)
\label{eq:corr}$$

Similar power law behaviour is found for the order parameter $Q$ (in
this case the magnetisation) which vanishes in a singular fashion (it
has infinite gradient) as the critical point is is approached as a
function of temperature:

$$m \propto t^{\beta} ~~~~ (T < T_c,\: H=0) \label{eq:mag},$$
(here the symbol $\beta$, is not to be confused with $\beta=1/k_BT$--
this unfortunately is the standard notation.)

Finally, as a function of magnetic field:

$$m \propto h^{1/\delta} ~~~~ (T = T_c,\: H>0) \label{eq:field}.$$
with $h=(H-H_c)/H_c$, the reduced magnetic field.

As examples, the behaviour of the magnetisation and correlation length
are plotted in fig. [4](#fig:sing){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:sing"} as a function of $t$.

<figure id="fig:sing">

<figcaption>Singular behaviour of the correlation length and order
parameter in the vicinity of the critical point.</figcaption>
</figure>

The quantities $\gamma, \alpha, \nu, \beta$ in the above equations are
known as critical exponents. They serve to control the rate at which the
various thermodynamic quantities change on the approach to criticality.

Remarkably, the form of singular behaviour observed at criticality for
the example ferromagnet also occurs in qualitatively quite different
systems such as the fluid. All that is required to obtain the
corresponding power law relationships for the fluid is to substitute the
analogous thermodynamic quantities in to the above equations.
Accordingly the magnetisation order parameter is replaced by the density
difference $\rho_{liq}-\rho_{gas}$ while the susceptibility is replaced
by the isothermal compressibility and the specific heat capacity at
constant field is replaced by the specific heat capacity at constant
volume. The approach to criticality in a variety of qualitatively quite
different systems can therefore be expressed in terms of a set of
critical exponents describing the power law behaviour for that system
(see the book by Yeomans for examples).

Even more remarkable is the experimental observation that the values of
the critical exponents for a whole range of fluids and magnets (and
indeed many other systems with critical points) are *identical*. This is
the phenomenon of *universality*. It implies a deep underlying physical
similarity between ostensibly disparate critical systems. The principal
aim of theories of critical point phenomena is to provide a sound
theoretical basis for the existence of power law behaviour, the factors
governing the observed values of critical exponents and the universality
phenomenon. Ultimately this basis is provided by the Renormalisation
Group (RG) theory, for which K.G. Wilson was awarded the Nobel Prize in
Physics in 1982.

# The Ising model: the prototype model for a phase transition {#sec:models}

In order to probe the properties of the critical region, it is common to
appeal to simplified model systems whose behaviour parallels that of
real materials. The sophistication of any particular model depends on
the properties of the system it is supposed to represent. The simplest
model to exhibit critical phenomena is the two-dimensional Ising model
of a ferromagnet. Actual physical realizations of 2-d magnetic systems
do exist in the form of layered ferromagnets such as K$_2$CoF$_4$, so
the 2-d Ising model is of more than just technical relevance.

## The 2D Ising model

The 2-d spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Ising model envisages a regular arrangement
of magnetic moments or 'spins' on an infinite plane. Each spin can take
two values, $+1$ ('up' spins) or $-1$ ('down' spins) and is assumed to
interact with its nearest neighbours according to the Hamiltonian

$${\cal H}_I=-J\sum_{<ij>}s_is_j - H\sum_i s_i
\label{eq:ising}$$ where $J>0$ measures the strength of the coupling
between spins and the sum extends over nearest neighbour spins $s_i$ and
$s_j$, i.e it is a sum of the bonds of the lattice. $H$ is a magnetic
field term which can be positive or negative (although for the time
being we will set it equal to zero). The order parameter is simply the
average magnetisation:

$$m=\frac{1}{N} \langle \sum_i s_i \rangle\:,$$ where
$\langle\cdot\rangle$ means an average over configurations.

The fact that the Ising model displays a phase transition was argued in
sec. [2](#sec:background){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:background"}. Thus at low temperatures for which there is
little thermal disorder, there is a preponderance of aligned spins and
hence a net spontaneous magnetic moment (ie. the system is
ferromagnetic). As the temperature is raised, thermal disorder increases
until at a certain temperature $T_c$, entropy drives the system through
a continuous phase transition to a disordered spin arrangement with zero
net magnetisation (ie. the system is paramagnetic). These trends are
visible in configurational snapshots from computer simulations of the 2D
Ising model (see fig. [5](#fig:snapshots){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:snapshots"}). Although each spin interacts only with its
nearest neighbours, the phase transition occurs due to cooperative
effects among a large number of spins. In the neighbourhood of the
transition temperature these cooperative effects engender fluctuations
that can extend over all length-scales from the lattice spacing up to
the correlation length.

An interactive Java based Monte Carlo simulation of the Ising model can
be found at\
http://www.pha.jhu.edu/ javalab/ising/ising.html (accessible via the
Moodle page). By altering the temperature you will be able to observe
for yourself how the spin arrangements change as one traverses the
critical region. Pay particular attention to the configurations near the
critical point. They have very interesting properties. We will return to
them later!

Although the 2-d Ising model may appear at first sight to be an
excessively simplistic portrayal of a real magnetic system, critical
point universality implies that many physical observables such as
critical exponents are not materially influenced by the actual nature of
the microscopic interactions. The Ising model therefore provides a
simple, yet *quantitatively* accurate representation of the critical
properties of a whole range of real magnetic (and indeed fluid) systems.
This universal feature of the model is largely responsible for its
ubiquity in the field of critical phenomena. We shall explore these
ideas in more detail later in the course.

## Exact solutions: the one dimensional Ising chain

One might well ask why the 2D Ising model is the simplest model to
exhibit a phase transition. What about the one-dimensional Ising model
(ie. spins on a line)? In fact in one dimension, the Ising model can be
solved exactly. It turns out that the system is paramagnetic for all
$T>0$, so there is no phase transition at any finite temperature. To see
this, consider the ground state of the system in zero external field.
This will have all spins aligned the same way (say up), and hence be
ferromagnetic. Now consider a configuration with a various "domain
walls" dividing spin up and spin down regions:

<figure id="fig:chain">

<figcaption><span><strong>(a)</strong></span> Schematic of an Ising
chain at <span class="math inline"><em>T</em> = 0</span>.
<span><strong>(b)</strong></span> At a small finite temperature the
chain is split into domains of spins ordered in the same direction.
Domains are separated by notional domain “walls”, which cost energy
<span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em> = 2<em>J</em></span>. Periodic
boundary conditions are assumed.</figcaption>
</figure>

Instead of considering the underlying spin configurations, we shall
describe the system in terms of the statistics of its domain walls. The
energy cost of a wall is $\Delta = 2J$, independent of position. Domain
walls can occupy the bonds of the lattice, of which there are $N-1$.
Moreover, the walls are noninteracting, except that you cannot have two
of them on the same bond. (Check through these ideas if you are unsure.)

In this representation, the partition function involves a count over all
possible domain wall arrangements. Since the domain walls are non
interacting (eg it doesn't cost energy for one to move along the chain)
we can calculate $Z$ by considering the partition function associated
with a single domain wall being present or absent on some given bond,
and then simply raise to the power of the number of bonds:

$$Z=Z_1^{N-1}$$

where

$$Z_1=e^{\beta J} + e^{\beta (J-\Delta)}=e^{\beta J}(1+e^{-\beta\Delta})$$
is the domain wall partition function for a single bond and represent
the sum over the two possible states: domain wall absent or present.
Then the free energy per bond of the system is

$$\beta f\equiv \beta F/(N-1)=-\ln Z_1=-\beta J-\ln(1+e^{-\beta\Delta})$$

The first term on the RHS is simply the energy per spin of the
ferromagnetic (ordered) phase, while the second term arises from the
free energy of domain walls. Clearly for any finite temperature (ie. for
$\beta<\infty$), this second term is finite and negative. Hence the free
energy will always be lowered by having a finite concentration of domain
walls in the system. Since these domain walls disorder the system,
leading to a zero average magnetisation, the 1D system is paramagnetic
for all finite temperatures. *Exercise*: Explain why this argument works
only in 1D.

### More general 1D spins systems: transfer matrix method

Generally speaking one-dimensional systems lend themselves to a degree
of analytic tractability not found in most higher dimensional models.
Indeed for the case of a 1-d assembly of $N$ spins each having $m$
discrete energy states, and in the presence of a magnetic field, it is
possible to reduce the evaluation of the partition function to the
calculation of the eigenvalues of a matrix--the so called transfer
matrix.

Let us start by assuming that the assembly has cyclic boundary
conditions, then the total energy of configuration $\{s\}$ is

\begin{aligned}
H(\{s\})=&-\sum_{i=1}^N (Js_is_{i+1}+Hs_i)\\
\:=&-\sum_{i=1}^N (Js_is_{i+1}+H(s_i+s_{i+1})/2)\\
\:=&\sum_{i=1}^N E(s_i,s_{i+1})
\end{aligned}
 where we have defined $E(s_i,s_{i+1})=-Js_is_{i+1}-H(s_i+s_{i+1})/2$.

Now the partition function may be written

\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:tm}
Z_N =& \sum_{\{s\}}\exp\left(-\beta H(\{s\})\right)\nonumber \\
 =&\sum_{\{s\}}\exp\left(-\beta[E(s_1,s_2)+E(s_2,s_3)+....E(s_N,s_1)]\right) \nonumber\\
 =&\sum_{\{s\}}\exp\left(-\beta E(s_1,s_2)\right)\exp\left(-\beta E(s_2,s_3)\right)....\exp\left(-\beta E(s_N,s_1)\right) \nonumber\\
=&\sum_{i,j,...,l=1}^m V_{ij}V_{jk}...V_{li} \label{eq:Vs}
\end{aligned}
where the $V_{ij}=\exp(-\beta E_{ij})$ are elements of
an $m \times m$ matrix ${\bf V}$, known as the transfer matrix ($i,j,k$
etc are dummy indices that run over the matrix elements). You should see
that the sum over the product of matrix elements picks up all the terms
in the partition function and therefore
Eq. [\[eq:Vs\]](#eq:Vs){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:Vs"} is an
alternative way of writing the partition function.

The reason it is useful to transform to a matrix representation is that
it transpires that the sum over the product of matrix elements in
equation ([\[eq:Vs\]](#eq:Vs){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:Vs"})
is simply just the trace of ${\bf V}^N$ (check this yourself for a short
periodic chain), given by the sum of its eigenvalues:-

$$Z_N=\lambda_1^N+\lambda_2^N+...\lambda_m^N$$ For very large $N$, this
expression simplifies further because the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$
dominates the behaviour since $(\lambda_2/\lambda_1)^N$ vanishes as
$N\rightarrow \infty$. Consequently in the thermodynamic limit one may
put $Z_N=\lambda_1^N$ and the problem reduces to identifying the largest
eigenvalue of the transfer matrix.

Specializing to the case of the simple Ising model in the presence of an
applied field $H$, the transfer matrix takes the form

$${\bf V}(H)=\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
e^{\beta(J+H)} & e^{-\beta J} \\
e^{-\beta J}   & e^{\beta(J-H)}
\end{array} \right)$$

This matrix has two eigenvalues which can be readily calculated in the
usual fashion as the roots of the characteristic polynomial
$|{\bf V}-\lambda{\bf I}|$. They are

$$\lambda_{\pm}=e^{\beta J}\cosh(\beta H) \pm \sqrt{e^{2\beta J}\sinh^2\beta H+e^{-2\beta J}}.$$

Hence the free energy per spin $f=-k_BT\ln \lambda_+$ is

$$f=-k_BT\ln \left[e^{\beta J}\cosh(\beta H) + \sqrt{e^{2\beta J}\sinh^2\beta H+e^{-2\beta J}}\right].$$

The Ising model in 2D can also be solved exactly, as was done by Lars
Onsager in 1940. The solution is extremely complicated and is regarded
as one of the pinnacles of statistical mechanics. In 3D no exact
solution is known.

# Mean field theory and perturbation schemes

Of the wide variety of models of interest to the critical point
theorist, the majority have shown themselves intractable to direct
analytic (pen and paper) assault. In a very limited number of instances
models have been solved exactly, yielding the phase coexistence
parameters, critical exponents and the critical temperature. The 2-d
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Ising model is certainly the most celebrated such
example, its principal critical exponents are found to be
$\beta=\frac{1}{8}, \nu=1, \gamma=\frac{7}{4}$. Its critical temperature
is $-2J/\ln(\sqrt{2}-1)\approx 2.269J$. Unfortunately such solutions
rarely afford deep insight to the general framework of criticality
although they do act as an invaluable test-bed for new and existing
theories.

The inability to solve many models exactly often means that one must
resort to approximations. One such approximation scheme is mean field
theory.

## Mean field solution of the Ising model {#sec:mfising}

Let us look for a mean field expression for the free energy of the Ising
model whose Hamiltonian is given in Eq.
([\[eq:ising\]](#eq:ising){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:ising"}).
Write

$$s_i=\langle s_i\rangle+(s_i-\langle s_i\rangle)=m+(s_i-m)=m+\delta s_i$$

Then \begin{aligned}
{\cal H}_I=&-J\sum_{<i,j>}[m+(s_i-m)][m+(s_j-m)]-H\sum_i s_i\nonumber\\
=&-J\sum_{<i,j>}[m^2+m(s_i-m)+m(s_j-m)+\delta s_i\delta s_j]-H\sum_i s_i\nonumber\\
=&-J\sum_{i}(qms_i-qm^2/2)-H\sum_i s_i-J\sum_{<i,j>}\delta s_i\delta s_j\label{eq:mfa}
\end{aligned}
where in the last line we have used the fact that when
for each site $i$ we perform the sum $\sum_{<i,j>}$ over bonds of a
quantity which is independent of $s_j$, then the result is just the
number of bonds per site times that quantity. Since the number of bonds
on a lattice of $N$ sites of coordination $q$ is $Nq/2$ (because each
bond is shared between two sites), there are therefore $q/2$ bonds per
site.

Now the mean field approximation is to ignore the last term in
([\[eq:mfa\]](#eq:mfa){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:mfa"}) giving
the configurational energy as

$${\cal H}_{mf}=-\sum_{i}H_{mf}s_i+NqJm^2/2$$ with $H_{mf}\equiv qJm+ H$
the "mean field" seen by spin $s_i$. As all the spins are decoupled
(independent) in this approximation we can write down the partition
function, which follows by taking the partition function for a single
spin (by summing the Boltzmann factor for $s_i=\pm 1$) and raising to
the power $N$ to find

$$Z=e^{-\beta qJm^2N/2}[2\cosh(\beta(qJm+H))]^N$$

The free energy follows as

$$F(m)=NJqm^2/2-Nk_BT\ln[2\cosh(\beta (qJm+H)]\:.$$

and the magnetisation as

$$m=-\frac{1}{N}\frac{\partial F}{\partial H}=\tanh(\beta(qJm+H))$$

To find $m(H,T)$, we must numerically solve this last equation self
consistently.

Note that we can obtain $m$ in a different way. Consider some arbitary
spin, $s_i$ say. Then this spin has an energy ${\cal H}_{mf}(s_i)$.
Considering this energy for both cases $s_i=\pm 1$ and the probability
$p(s_i)=e^{-\beta{\cal H}_{mf}(s_i)}/Z$ of each, we have that

$$\langle s_i\rangle=\sum_{s_i=\pm 1}s_ip(s_i)$$ but for consistancy,
$\langle s_i\rangle=m$. Thus

\begin{aligned}
m =& \sum_{s_i=\pm 1}s_ip(s_i)\nonumber\\
 \:=& \frac{e^{\beta(qJm+H)}-e^{\beta(qJm+H)}} {e^{\beta(qJm+H)}+e^{-\beta(qJm+H)}}\nonumber\\
 \:=&\tanh(\beta(qJm+H)) \label{eq:mfmag}
\end{aligned} as before.

## Spontaneous symmetry breaking {#sec:breaking}

<figure id="fig:freeenergy">

<figcaption>Schematic of the form of the free energy for a critical,
subcritical and supercritical temperature.</figcaption>
</figure>

This mean field analysis reveals what is happening in the Ising model
near the critical temperature $T_c$.
Fig. [7](#fig:freeenergy){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:freeenergy"} shows sketches for $\beta F(m)/N$ as a
function of temperature, where for simplicity we restrict attention to
$H=0$. In this case $F(m)$ is symmetric in $m$, Moreover, at high $T$,
the entropy dominates and there is a single minimum in $F(m)$ at $m=0$.
At $T$ is lowered, there comes a point ($T=T_c=qJ/k_B$) where the
curvature of $F(m)$ at the origin changes sign; precisely at this point

$$\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial m^2}=0.$$ At lower temperature, there are
instead two minima at nonzero $m=\pm m^\star$, where the *equilibrium
magnetisation* $m^\star$ is the positive root (calculated explicitly
below) of

$$m^\star=\tanh(\beta Jqm^\star)= \tanh(\frac{m^\star T_c}{T})$$ The
point $m=0$ which remains a root of this equation, is clearly an
unstable point for $T<T_c$ (since $F$ has a maximum there).

This is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the absence of
an external field, the Hamiltonian (and therefore the free energy) is
symmetric under $m\to -m$. Accordingly, one might expect the actual
state of the system to also show this symmetry. This is true at high
temperature, but spontaneously breaks down at low ones. Instead there
are a pair of ferromagnetic states (spins mostly up, or spins mostly
down) which -- by symmetry-- have the same free energy, lower than the
unmagnetized state.

## Phase diagram

The resulting zero-field magnetisation curve $m(T,H=0)$ looks like
fig. [8](#fig:isingmag){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:isingmag"}.

<figure id="fig:isingmag">

<figcaption>Phase diagram of a simple magnet in the <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em>, <em>T</em></span> plane.</figcaption>
</figure>

This shows the sudden change of behaviour at $T_c$ (phase transition).
For $T<T_c$ it is arbitrary which of the two roots $\pm m^\star$ is
chosen; typically it will be different in different parts of the sample
(giving macroscopic "magnetic domains"). But this behaviour with
temperature is *qualitatively modified* by the presence of a field $H$,
however small. In that case, there is always a slight magnetization,
even far above $T_c$ and the curves becomes smoothed out, as shown.
There is no doubt which root will be chosen, and no sudden change of the
behaviour (no phase transition). Spontaneous symmetry breaking does not
occur, because the symmetry is already broken by $H$. (The curve $F(m)$
is lopsided, rather than symmetrical about $m=0$.)

On the other hand, if we sit below $T_c$ in a positive field (say) and
gradually reduce $H$ through zero so that it becomes negative, there is
a *very* sudden change of behaviour at $h=0$: the equilibrium state
jumps discontinuously from $m=m^\star$ to $m=-m^\star$.

<figure id="fig:isingpdH">

<figcaption>Phase diagram of a simple magnet in the <span
class="math inline"><em>H</em> − <em>T</em></span> plane.</figcaption>
</figure>

This is called a first order phase transition as opposed to the "second
order" or continuous transition that occurs at $T_c$ in zero field. The
definitions are:

*First order transition:* magnetisation (or similar order parameter)
depends discontinuously on a field variable (such as $h$ or $T$).

*Continuous transition:* Change of functional form, but no discontinuity
in $m$; typically, however, $(\partial m/\partial T)_h$ (or similar) is
either discontinuous, or diverges with an integrable singularity.

In this terminology, we can say that the phase diagram of the magnet in
the $H,T$ plane shows a line of first order phase transitions,
terminating at a continuous transition, which is the critical point.

*Aside*: Quantum Criticality

In some magnetic systems such as $CePd_2Si_2$, one can, by applying
pressure or altering the chemical composition, depress the critical
temperature all the way to abolute zero! This may seem counterintuitive,
after all at $T=0$ one should expect perfect ordering, not the large
fluctuations that accompany criticality. It turns out that the source of
the fluctuations that drive the system critical is zero point motion
associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Quantum
criticality is a matter of ongoing active research, and open questions
concern the nature of the phase diagrams and the relationship to
superconductivity. Although the subject goes beyond the scope of this
course, there are a couple of accessible articles on the Moodle page if
you want to learn more.

## A closer look: critical exponents

Let us now see how we can calculate critical exponents within the mean
field approximation.

### Zero H solution and the order parameter exponent

In zero field

$$m=\tanh(\frac{mT_c}{T})$$ where $T_c=qJ/k_B$ is the critical
temperature at which $m$ first goes to zero.

We look for a solution where $m$ is small ($\ll 1$). Expanding the tanh
function and replacing $\beta=(k_BT)^{-1}$ yields

$$m=\frac{mT_c}{T}-\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{mT_c}{T} \right)^3 +O(m^5)\:.$$
Then $m=0$ is one solution. The other solution is given by

$$m^2=3\left(\frac{T}{T_c} \right)^3\left(\frac{T_c}{T} -1\right)$$

Now, considering temperatures close to $T_c$ to guarantee small $m$, and
employing the reduced temperature $t=(T-T_c)/T_c$, one finds

$$m^2\simeq -3t$$

Hence

\begin{aligned}
m= 0  &    ~~~\textrm{for } T>T_c \:\:\:  \textrm{ since~otherwise~{\it m}~imaginary}\nonumber\\
m= \pm\sqrt{-3t} & ~~\textrm{ for}  \:\:\: T<T_c ~~\textrm{ real}
\label{eq:mbeta}
\end{aligned} 
This result implies that (within the mean field
approximation) the critical exponent $\beta=1/2$.

### Finite (but small) field solution: the susceptibility exponent {#sec:closerlook}

In a finite, but small field we can expand
Eq. ([\[eq:mfmag\]](#eq:mfmag){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:mfmag"}) thus:

$$m=\frac{mT_c}{T}-\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{mT_c}{T} \right)^3 +\frac{H}{kT}$$

Consider now the isothermal susceptibility

\begin{aligned}
\chi  \equiv & \left(\frac{\partial m}{\partial H}\right)_T\\
      =     & \frac{T_c}{T}\chi - \left(\frac{T_c}{T}\right)^3 \chi m^2 + \frac{1}{k_BT}  
\end{aligned}

Then

$$\chi \left[ 1-\frac{T_c}{T} +\left(\frac{T_c}{T}\right)^3m^2  \right]=\frac{1}{k_BT}$$

Hence near $T_c$

$$\chi=\frac{1}{k_BT_c}\left(\frac{1}{t+m^2}\right)$$

Then using the results of
Eq. ([\[eq:mbeta\]](#eq:mbeta){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:mbeta"}) \
begin{aligned}
\chi= (k_BT_ct)^{-1} & \textrm{ for} ~~~ T> T_c \\
\chi= (-2k_BT_ct)^{-1} & \textrm{ for}  ~~~T \le T_c 
\end{aligned} 
where one has to take the non-zero value for $m$ below
$T_c$ to ensure +ve $\chi$, i.e. thermodynamic stability. This result
implies that (within the mean field approximation) the critical exponent
$\gamma=1$.

The schematic behaviour of the Ising order parameter and susceptibility
are shown in fig. [10](#fig:mfsum){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:mfsum"}.

<figure id="fig:mfsum">

<figcaption>Mean field behaviour of the Ising magnetisation and
susceptibility (schematic)</figcaption>
</figure>

## Landau theory

Landau theory is a slightly more general type of mean field theory than
that discussed in the previous subsection because it is not based on a
particular microscopic model. Its starting point is the Helmholtz free
energy, which Landau asserted can be written in terms of a truncated
power series expansion of the order parameter. For a ferromagnet this
takes the form

$$F(m)=F_0+a_2m^2+a_4m^4
\label{eq:landau}$$

Here only the terms compatible with the order parameter symmetry are
included in the expansion. On symmetry grounds, the free energy of a
ferromagnet should be invariant under a reversal of the sign of the
magnetisation. Terms linear and cubic in $m$ are not invariant under
$m\to -m$, and so do not feature.

One can understand how the Landau free energy can give rise to a
critical point by plotting its form for various values of $a_2$ with
$a_4$ assumed positive (which ensures that the magnetisation remains
bounded). This is shown in fig. [11](#fig:landau){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:landau"}

<figure id="fig:landau">

<figcaption>Form of the Landau Free energy for a selection of values of
the <span class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub>2</sub></span>
parameter.</figcaption>
</figure>

The situation is qualitatively similar to that discussed in
sec [5.2](#sec:breaking){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:breaking"}.
Thermodynamics tells us that the system adopts the state of lowest free
energy. Thus from fig. [11](#fig:landau){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:landau"}, we see that for $a_2>0$, the system will have
$m=0$, i.e. will be in the disordered (or paramagnetic) phase. For
$a_2<0$, the minimum in the free energy occurs at a finite value of $m$,
indicating that the ordered (ferromagnetic) phase is the stable one. In
fact, the physical (up-down) spin symmetry built into $F$ indicates that
there are two equivalent stable states at $m=\pm m^\star$. $a_2=0$
corresponds to the critical point which marks the border between the
ordered and disordered phases.

Clearly $a_2$ controls the deviation from the critical temperature, and
accordingly we may write

$$a_2=\tilde{a_2} t$$ where $t$ is the reduced temperature.

We can now attempt to calculate critical exponents. Restricting
ourselves first to the magnetisation exponent $\beta$ defined by
$m=t^\beta$, we first find the equilibrium magnetisation, corresponding
to the minimum of the Landau free energy:

$$\frac{dF}{dm}=2\tilde{a_2} tm+4a_4m^3=0
\label{eq:minimize}$$

which implies

$$m\propto (-t)^{1/2},$$ so $\beta=1/2$, which is again a mean field
result.

Likewise we can calculate the effect of a small field $H$ if we sit at
the critical temperature $T_c$. Since $a_2=0$, we have

$$F(m)=F_0+a_4m^4-Hm$$

$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial m}=0 \Rightarrow m(H,T_c)=\left(\frac{H}{4a_4}\right)^{1/3}$$

or

$$H \sim m^\delta ~~~~~ \delta=3$$ which defines a second
critical exponent.

Note that at the critical point, a small applied field causes a very big
increase in magnetisation; formally, $(\partial m/\partial H)_T$ is
infinite at $T=T_c$.

A third critical exponent can be defined from the magnetic
susceptibility at zero field

$$\chi=\left(\frac{\partial m}{\partial H}\right)_{T,V} \sim |T-T_c|^{-\gamma}$$

*Exercise*: Show that the Landau expansion predicts $\gamma=1$.

Finally we define a fourth critical exponent via the variation of the
heat capacity (per site or per unit volume) $C_H$, in fixed external
field $H=0$:

$$C_H \sim |T-T_c|^{-\alpha}$$

By convention, $\alpha$ is defined to be positive for systems where
there is a *divergence* of the heat capacity at the critical point (very
often the case). The heat capacity can be calculated from

$$C_H =-T\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial T^2}$$

From the minimization over $m$
(Eq. [\[eq:minimize\]](#eq:minimize){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:minimize"}, one finds (*exercise*: check this)

\begin{aligned}
F = & 0 ~~~~T>T_c\nonumber\\
F = & -a_2^2/4a_4 ~~~~ T < T_c
\end{aligned} 
Using the fact that $a_2$ varies linearly with $T$, we have

\begin{aligned}
C_H =& 0 ~~~~ T\to T_c^+\nonumber\\
C_H =& \frac{T\tilde a_2^2}{2a_4} ~~~~ T \to T_c^-\:,
\end{aligned} 
which is actually a step discontinuity in specific heat.
Since for positive $\alpha$ the heat capacity is divergent, and for
negative $\alpha$ it is continuous, this behaviour formally corresponds
to $\alpha=0$

## Shortcomings of mean field theory

While mean field theories provide a useful route to understanding
qualitatively the phenomenology of phase transitions, in real
ferromagnets, as well as in more sophisticated theories, the critical
exponents are not the simple fraction and integers found here. This
failure of mean field theory to predict the correct exponents is of
course traceable to their neglect of correlations. In later sections we
shall start to take the first steps to including the effects of long
range correlations.

# The Lattice Gas model

A crude representation of a fluid is the lattice gas model. Here
particles can occupy the sites of a hypercubic lattice. The occupancy of
a site $i$ is specified by the variable $c_i=1$ (occupied) or $c_i=0$
vacant. The complete list of these occupancies $\{c\}$ specifies a
microstate. The average particle number density (fraction of occupied
sites) is given by

$$c=L^{-d}\sum_ic_i$$ where $L$ is the linear extent of the lattice and
$d$ its dimensionality.

The Hamiltonian of the lattice gas model is

$${\cal H}_{LG}=-\epsilon\sum_{<i,j>}c_ic_j - \mu\sum_ic_i$$

where $\epsilon$ is an attraction energy between a pair of particles on
adjacent (nearest neighbouring) sites and $\mu$ is a field known as the
chemical potential, which couples to the particle density which is
assumed to fluctuate around a mean value controlled by the prescribed
chemical potential. This representation of the model in which the
overall density fluctuates is known as the *Grand Canonical ensemble.*

## Mapping between Ising model and lattice gas

The lattice gas model is interesting because whilst being a plausible
model for a fluid, it maps onto the Ising model. This extends the
applicability of the Ising model. To expose the mapping we write the
grand partition function of the lattice gas:

$$\Xi=\sum_\textrm{ state}\exp-\beta{\cal H}_{LG}=\sum_{\{c\}}\exp\left[\beta \epsilon\sum_{<i,j>}c_ic_j +\beta\mu\sum_ic_i\right]$$
where the sum is an unrestricted sum over the occupancies of the lattice
sites. We now change variables to

$$c_i=(1+s_i)/2; ~~~~ J=\frac{\epsilon}{4} ~~~~
h=\frac{\epsilon q+2\mu}{4}$$ Hence

$${\cal H}_{LG}={\cal H}_\textrm{ I} + \textrm{ constant}$$ Since the last term
does not depend on the configuration, it feeds through as an additive
constant in the free energy; and since all observables feature as
derivatives of the free energy, the constant has no physical
implications.

## Phase diagram

Using these translation rules we can plot the phase diagram of the
lattice gas in the $\mu-T$ plane.

<figure id="fig:lattgas">

<figcaption>Phase diagram of the lattice gas model</figcaption>
</figure>

Again there is a line of first order phase transitions terminating at a
critical point. The first order line means that if $T<T_c$ we smoothly
increase the chemical potential through the coexistence value of $\mu$,
the density of particles on our lattice $c$ jumps discontinuously from a
low to a high value.

$$c_\textrm{ gas}=\frac{1-m^\star}{2} \to c_\textrm{ liquid}=\frac{1+m^\star}{2}$$
These values merge at $T_c$, the gas-liquid critical point. At higher
temperatures, the distinction between the phases disappears.

## Real Fluids

You may wish to compare this with the results of (say) van der Waals
equation (see recommended textbooks for the required phase diagram). The
main difference is that the lattice gas has "Particle-hole" symmetry,
$c\to 1-c$ which is not present for an ordinary fluid. Accordingly, the
phase diagram in a real fluid looks like a lopsided version of the above
picture.

# Series expansion {#sec:series}

For many years prior to the introduction of the renormalisation group
method, the bedrock of information about true (i.e. non mean-field)
criticality in model systems was provided by series expansion
techniques. These methods seek to deduce results for the critical region
using known results obtained away from criticality. One simple example
is the high-temperature series which expresses the Boltzmann factor in
terms of a temperature expansion with $1/T$ assumed small.

$$\exp(-{\cal H}/k_BT)=1-{\cal H}/k_BT +\frac{1}{2!}({\cal H}/k_BT)^2+.....$$

Successively higher terms in this series can be regarded as
characterizing correlations over successively larger distances. Known
results for the high-temperature fully disordered phase can be applied
to permit the (rather laborious) calculation of the partition function
$Z$ using the significant terms in this expansion. This procedure can
yield surprisingly accurate numerical results although it is typical
that the expansions break down close to the critical point, a failure
that can be traced back to the divergent correlation length.

# The Static Scaling Hypothesis

Historically, the first step towards properly elucidating near-critical
behaviour was taken with the static scaling hypothesis. This is
essentially a plausible conjecture concerning the origin of power law
behaviour which appears to be consistent with observed phenomena.
According to the hypothesis, the basis for power law behaviour (and
associated scale invariance or "scaling") in near-critical systems is
expressed in the claim that: in the neighbourhood of a critical point,
the basic thermodynamic functions (most notably the free energy) are
*generalized homogeneous functions* of their variables. For such
functions one can always deduce a scaling law such that by an
appropriate change of scale, the dependence on two variables (e.g. the
temperature and applied field) can be reduced to dependence on one new
variable. This claim may be warranted by the following general argument.

A function of two variables $g(u,v)$ is called a generalized homogeneous
function if it has the property

$$g(\lambda^au,\lambda^bv)=\lambda g(u,v)$$ **for all $\lambda$**, where
the parameters $a$ and $b$ (known as scaling parameters) are constants.
An example of such a function is $g(u,v)=u^3+v^2$ with $a=1/3, b=1/2$.

Now, the arbitrary scale factor $\lambda$ can be redefined without loss
of generality as $\lambda^a=u^{-1}$ giving

$$g(u,v)=u^{1/a}g(1,\frac{v}{u^{b/a}})$$ A corresponding relation is
obtained by choosing the rescaling to be $\lambda^b=v^{-1}$.

$$\label{eq:sca2}
g(u,v)=v^{1/b}g(\frac{u}{v^{a/b}},1)$$

This equation demonstrates that $g(u,v)$ indeed satisfies a simple power
law in $\it{one}$ variable, subject to the constraint that $u/v^{a/b}$
is a constant. It should be stressed, however, that such a scaling
relation specifies neither the function $g$ nor the parameters $a$ and
$b$.

Now, the static scaling hypothesis asserts that in the critical region,
the free energy $F$ is a generalized homogeneous function of the
(reduced) thermodynamic fields $t=(T-T_c)/T_c$ and $h=(H-H_c)$.
Remaining with the example ferromagnet, the following scaling assumption
can then be made:

$$F(\lambda^a t,\lambda^b h)=\lambda F(t,h) \:.
\label{eq:scagibbs}$$

Without loss of generality, we can set $\lambda^a=t^{-1}$, implying
$\lambda=t^{-1/a}$ and $\lambda^b=t^{-b/a}$.

Then $$F(t,h)=t^{1/a}F(1,t^{-b/a}h)$$ where our choice of $\lambda$
ensures that $F$ on the rhs is now a function of a single variable
$t^{-b/a}h$.

Now, as stated in sec. [2](#sec:background){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:background"} the free energy provides the route to all
thermodynamic functions of interest. An expression for the magnetisation
can be obtained simply by taking the field derivative of $F$ (cf.
fig. [3](#fig:thermo){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:thermo"})

$$m(t,h)=-t^{(1-b)/a}m(1,t^{-b/a}h)
\label{eq:magscale}$$

In zero applied field $h=0$, this reduces to

$$m(t,0)=(-t)^{(1-b)/a}m(1,0)$$ where the r.h.s. is a power law in $t$.
Equation ([\[eq:mag\]](#eq:mag){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:mag"}) then allows identification of the exponent $\beta$
in terms of the scaling parameters $a$ and $b$.

$$\beta=\frac{1-b}{a}$$

By taking further appropriate derivatives of the free energy, other
relations between scaling parameters and critical exponents may be
deduced. Such calculations yield the results $\delta =
b/(1-b)$,$\gamma = (2b-1)/a$, and $\alpha =(2a-1)/a$ [^1]. Relationships
between the critical exponents themselves can be obtained trivially by
eliminating the scaling parameters from these equations. The principal
results (known as "scaling laws") are:-

\begin{aligned}
\alpha+\beta(\delta+1)=2 \\
\alpha+2\beta+\gamma=2
\end{aligned} Thus, provided all critical exponents can be expressed
in terms of the scaling parameters $a$ and $b$, then only two critical
exponents need be specified, for all others to be deduced. Of course
these scaling laws are also expected to hold for the appropriate
thermodynamic functions of analogous systems such as the liquid-gas
critical point.

## Experimental Verification of Scaling

The validity of the scaling hypothesis finds startling verification in
experiment. To facilitate contact with experimental data for real
systems, consider again
eq. [\[eq:magscale\]](#eq:magscale){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:magscale"}. Eliminating the scaling parameters $a$ and $b$
in favour of the exponents $\beta$ and $\delta$ gives

$$\frac{m(t,h)}{t^{\beta}}=m(1,\frac{h}{t^{\beta\delta}})$$ where the
RHS of this last equation can be regarded as a function of the single
scaled variable $\tilde{H} \equiv t^{-\beta\delta} h(t,M)$.

For some particular magnetic system, one can perform an experiment in
which one measures $m$ vs $h$ for various fixed temperatures. This
allows one to draw a set of isotherms, i.e. $m-h$ curves of constant
$t$. These can be used to demonstrate scaling by plotting the data
against the scaling variables $M=t^{-\beta}m(t,h)$ and
$\tilde{H}=t^{-\beta\delta}h(t,M)$. Under this scale transformation, it
is found that all isotherms (for $t$ close to zero) coincide to within
experimental error. Reassuringly, similar results are found using the
scaled equation of state of simple fluid systems such as He$^3$ or Xe.

![Magnetisation of CrBr$_3$ in the critical region plotted in scaled
form (see text).](Figs/scaling1.pdf){#fig:scaling width="10.0cm"}

In summary, the static scaling hypothesis is remarkably successful in
providing a foundation for the observation of power laws and scaling
phenomena. However, it furnishes little or no guidance regarding the
role of co-operative phenomena at the critical point. In particular it
provides no means for calculating the values of the critical exponents
appropriate to given model systems.

## Computer simulation {#sec:compsim}

In seeking to employ simulation to obtain estimates of bulk critical
point properties (such as the location of a critical point and the
values of its associated exponents), one is immediately confronted with
a difficulty. The problem is that simulations are necessarily restricted
to dealing with systems of finite-size and cannot therefore accommodate
the truly long ranged fluctuations that characterize the near-critical
regime. As a consequence, the critical singularities in $C_v$, order
parameter, etc. appear rounded and shifted in a simulation study.
Fig. [14](#fig:shift){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:shift"} shows
a schematic example for the susceptibility of a magnet.

<figure id="fig:shift">

<figcaption>Schematic of the near-critical temperature dependence of the
magnet susceptibility in a finite-sized system.</figcaption>
</figure>

Thus the position of the peak in a response function (such as $C_v$)
measured for a finite-sized system does not provide an accurate estimate
of the critical temperature. Although the degree of rounding and
shifting reduces with system size, it is often the case, that
computational constraints prevent access to the largest system sizes
which would provide accurate estimates of critical parameters. To help
deal with this difficulty, finite-size scaling (FSS) methods have been
developed to allow extraction of bulk critical properties from
simulations of finite size. FSS will be discussed
in [9.7](#sec:fss){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:fss"}.

# The Renormalisation Group Theory of Critical Phenomena

*Owing the the absence of a wholly appropriate textbook for the material
covered in this section, I have supplied more detailed notes than used
in other parts of the unit.*

The critical region is characterised by correlated microstructure on
$\underline{all}$ length-scales up to and including the correlation
length. Such a profusion of degrees of freedom can only be accurately
characterized by a very large number of variables. Mean field theories
and approximation schemes fail in the critical region because they at
best incorporate interactions among only a few spins, while neglecting
correlations over larger distances. Similarly, the scaling hypothesis
fails to provide more than a qualitative insight into the nature of
criticality because it focuses on only one length-scale, namely the
correlation length itself. Evidently a fuller understanding of the
critical region may only be attained by taking account of the existence
of structure on all length-scales. Such a scheme is provided by the
renormalisation group method, which stands today as the cornerstone of
the modern theory of critical phenomena.

## The critical point: A many length scale problem

A near critical system can be characterized by three important length
scales, namely

1.  The correlation length, $\xi$, ie the size of correlated
    microstructure.

2.  Minimum length scale $L_\textrm{ min}$, i.e. the smallest length in the
    microscopics of the problem, e.g. lattice spacing of a magnet or the
    particle size in a fluid.

3.  Macroscopic size $L_{max}$ eg. size of the system.

The authentic critical region is defined by a window condition:

$$L_\textrm{ max} \gg \xi \gg L_\textrm{ min}$$

The physics of this regime is hard to tackle by analytic theory because
it is characterized by configurational structure on all scales between
$L_\textrm{ min}$ and $\xi$ (in fact it turns out that the near critical
configurational patterns are *fractal*-like, cf.
fig. [5](#fig:snapshots){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:snapshots"}(b)). Moreover different length scales are
correlated with one another, giving rise to a profusion of coupled
variables in any theoretical description. The window regime is also not
easily accessed by computer simulation because it entails studying very
large system sizes $L_\textrm{
max}$, often requiring considerable computing resources.

## Methodology of the RG {#sec:rgmethod}

The central idea of the renormalisation group (RG) method is a stepwise
elimination of the degrees of freedom of the system on successively
larger length-scales. To achieve this one introduces a fourth length
scale $L$. In contrast to the other three, which characterize the system
itself, $L$ characterises the *description* of the system. It may be
thought of as typifying the size of the smallest resolvable detail in a
description of the system's microstructure.

Consider the Ising model arrangements displayed in
fig. [5](#fig:snapshots){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:snapshots"}(a)-(c). These pictures contain *all* the
details of each configuration shown: the resolution length $L$ in this
case has its smallest possible value, coinciding with the lattice
spacing i.e. $L=L_{\min}$. In the present context, the most detailed
description is not the most useful: the essential signals with which we
are concerned are hidden in a noise of relevant detail. A clue to
eliminating this noise lies in the nature of the correlation length,
i.e. the size of the largest droplets. The explicit form of the small
scale microstructure is irrelevant to the behaviour of $\xi$. The small
scale microstructure is the noise. To eliminate it, we simply select a
larger value of the resolution length (or 'coarse-graining' length) $L$.

There are many ways of implementing this coarse-graining procedure. We
adopt a simple strategy in which we divide our sample into blocks of
side $L$, each of which contains $L^d$ sites, with $d$ the space
dimensions . The centres of the blocks define a lattice of points
indexed by $I=1,2,....,N/L^d$. We associate with each block lattice
point centre, $I$, a coarse-grained or block variable $S_I(L)$ defined
as the spatial average of the local variables it contains:

$$S_I(L)=L^{-d}\sum_i^Is_i
\label{eq:blkvar}$$ where the sum extends over the $L^d$ sites in the
block $I$. The set of coarse grained coordinates $\{S(L)\}$ are the
basic ingredients of a picture of the system having spatial resolution
of order $L$.

The coarse graining operation is easily implemented on a computer. In so
doing one is faced with the fact that while the underlying Ising spins
can only take two possible values, the block variables $S_I(L)$ have
$L^d+1$ possible values. Accordingly in displaying the consequences of
the blocking procedure, we need a more elaborate colour convention than
that used in fig. [5](#fig:snapshots){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:snapshots"}. We will associate with each block a shade of
grey drawn from a spectrum ranging from black to white.

![See text for details](Figs/coarseconf1.pdf){#fig:c1 width="12.5cm"}

The results of coarse-graining configurations typical of three different
temperatures are shown in fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:c1"} and fig. [16](#fig:c2){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:c2"}. Two auxiliary operations are implicit in these
results. The first operation is a *length scaling*: the lattice spacing
on each blocked lattice has been scaled to the same size as that of the
original lattice, making possible the display of correspondingly larger
portions of the physical system. The second operation is a *variable
scaling*: loosely speaking, we have adjusted the scale ('contrast') of
the block variable so as to match the spectrum of block variable values
to the spectrum of shades at our disposal.

Consider first a system marginally above its critical point at a
temperature $T$ chosen so that the correlation length $\xi$ is
approximately 6 lattice spacing units. A typical arrangement (without
coarse-graining) is shown in fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:c1"}(ai). The succeeding figures,
 [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c1"}(aii) and
 [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c1"}(aiii), show the
result of coarse-graining with block sizes $L=4$ and $L=8$,
respectively. A clear trend is apparent. The coarse-graining *amplifies*
the consequences of the small deviation of $T$ from $T_c$. As $L$ is
increased, the ratio of the size of the largest configurational features
($\xi$) to the size of the smallest ($L$) is reduced. The ratio $\xi/L$
provides a natural measure of how 'critical' is a configuration. Thus
the coarse-graining operation generates a representation of the system
that is effectively less critical the larger the coarse-graining length.
The limit point of this trend is the effectively fully disordered
arrangement shown in fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:c1"}(aiii) and in an alternative form in
fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c1"}(aiv), which
shows the limiting distribution of the coarse grained variables,
averaged over many realizations of the underlying configurations: the
distribution is a Gaussian which is narrow (even more so the larger the
$L$ value) and centred on zero. This limit is easily understood. When
the system is viewed on a scaled $L$ larger than $\xi$, the correlated
microstructure is no longer explicitly apparent; each coarse-grained
variable is essentially independent of the others.

A similar trend is apparent below the critical point.
Fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c1"}(bi) show a
typical arrangement at a temperature $T<T_c$ such that again $\xi$ is
approximately $6$ lattice spacings. Coarse-graining with $L=4$ and $L=8$
again generates representations which are effectively less critical
(figs. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c1"}(bii) and
(biii)). This time the coarse-graining smoothes out the microstructure
which makes the order incomplete. The limit point of this procedure is a
homogeneously ordered arrangement in which the block variables have a
random (Gaussian) distribution centred on the order parameter
(fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c1"}(biv)).

Consider now the situation *at* the critical point.
Fig. [16](#fig:c2){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c2"}(ai) shows a
typical arrangement; figs.  [16](#fig:c2){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:c2"}(aii) and (aiii) show the results of coarse-graining
with $L=4$ and $L=8$ respectively. Since the $\xi$ is as large as the
system itself the coarse graining does not produce less critical
representations of the physical system: each of the figures displays
structure over *all* length scales between the lower limit set by $L$
and the upper limit set by the size of the display itself. A limiting
trend is nevertheless apparent. Although the $L=4$ pattern is
qualitatively quite different from the pattern of the local variables,
the $L=4$ and $L=8$ patterns display qualitatively similar features.
These similarities are more profound than is immediately apparent. A
statistical analysis of the spectrum of $L=4$ configurations (generated
as the local variables evolve in time) show that it is almost identical
to that of the $L=8$ configurations (given the block variable scaling).
The implication of this limiting behaviour is clear: the patterns formed
by the ordering variable at criticality look the same (in a statistical
sense) when viewed on all sufficiently large length scales.

![See text for details](Figs/coarseconf2.pdf){#fig:c2 width="12.0cm"}

Let us summarize. Under the coarse-graining operation there is an
evolution or *flow* of the system's configuration spectrum. The flow
tends to a limit, or fixed point, such that the pattern spectrum does
not change under further coarse-graining. These scale-invariant limits
have a trivial character for $T>T_c$, (a perfectly disordered
arrangement) and $T
< T_c$, (a perfectly ordered arrangement). The hallmark of the critical
point is the existence of a scale-invariant limit which is neither fully
ordered nor fully disordered but which possesses structure on all length
scales.

## Universality and Scaling

Equipped with the coarse-graining technique, we now address the
universality phenomenon. We aim to understand how it is that systems
that are different microscopically can nevertheless display critical
point behaviour which (in certain respects) is quantitatively identical.

To obtain initial insight we introduce a spin-1 Ising model in which the
spins take on three values ($s_i=1,0,-1$), in contrast to the two values
($s_i=1,-1$) of the spin-1/2 Ising model. The two models have properties
which are different: for example, $T_c$ for the three-state model is
some $30\%$ lower than that of the two-state model (for the same
coupling $J$). However, there is abundant evidence that the two models
have the same universal properties.

Let us explore what is the same and what is different in the
configurations of the two models at criticality. The configurations of
the local variables $s_i$ are clearly qualitatively different for the
two models. Now consider the coarse-grained configurations (with $L=4$
and $L=8$ respectively) for the three-state model at the critical point.
We have already seen that the coarse-graining operation bears the
configuration spectrum of the critical two-state Ising model to a
non-trivial scale-invariant limit. It is scarcely surprising that the
same is true for the three-state model. What is remarkable is that the
two limits are the same! This is expressed in
fig. [16](#fig:c2){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:c2"}(iv), which
shows the near coincidence of the distribution of block variables
(grey-levels) for the two different coarse-graining lengths. Thus the
coarse-graining erases the physical differences apparent in
configurations where the local behaviour is resolvable, and exposes a
profound configurational similarity.

### Fluid-magnet universality

Let us now turn to fluid-magnet universality. In a magnet, the relevant
configurations are those formed by the coarse-grained magnetisation (the
magnetic moment averaged over a block of side $L$). In a fluid, the
relevant configurations are those of the coarse-grained density (the
mass averaged over a block if side $L$) or more precisely, its
fluctuation from its macroscopic average
(Fig. [17](#fig:fmcoarse){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:fmcoarse"}). The patterns in the latter (bubbles of
liquid or vapour) may be matched to pattern in the former (microdomains
of the magnetisation), given appropriate scaling operations to
camouflage the differences between the length scales and the differences
between the variable scales.

the universal properties of fluids and magnets may be

sufficiently large length scales the configurational patterns appear
universal and self similar. </figcaption>
</figure>

## Near critical scaling

The similarity of coarse-grained configurations of different systems is
not restricted to the critical temperature itself. Suppose we have a two
state spin model and a three state spin model each somewhat above their
critical points at reduced temperature $t$. The two systems will have
somewhat different correlation lengths, $\xi_1$ and $\xi_2$ say. Suppose
however, we choose coarse-graining lengths $L_1$ for $L_2$ for the two
models such that $\xi_1/L_1=\xi_2/L_2$. We adjust the scales of the
block variables (our grey level control) so that the typical variable
value is the same for the two systems. We adjust the length scale of the
systems (stretch or shrink our snapshots) so that the sizes of the
minimum-length-scale structure (set by $L_1$ and $L_2$) looks the same
for each system. Precisely what they look like depends upon our choice
of $\xi/L$.

## Universality classes {#sec:unipics}

Coarse graining does not erase all differences between the physical
properties of critical systems. Differences in the space dimension $d$
of two critical systems will lead to different universal properties such
as critical exponents. Thus, for instance, the critical exponents of the
2D magnet, match those of the 2d fluid, but they are different to those
of 3d magnets and fluids.

In fact the space dimension is one of a small set of qualitative
features of a critical system which are sufficiently deep-seated to
survive coarse graining and which together serve to define the system's
universal behaviour, or *universality class*. The constituents of this
set are not all identifiable *a priori*. They include the number of
components $n$ of the order parameter. Up to now, we have only
considered order parameters which are scalar (for a fluid the density,
for a magnet the magnetisation), for which $n=1$. In some ferromagnets,
the order parameter may have components along two axes, or three axes,
implying a vector order parameter, with $n=2$ or $n=3$, respectively. It
is clear that the order-parameter $n$-value will be reflected in the
nature of the coarse-grained configurations, and thus in the universal
observables they imply.

A third important feature which can change the universality class of a
critical system is the range of the interaction potential between its
constituent particles. Clearly for the Ising model, interactions between
spins are inherently nearest neighbour in character. Most fluids
interact via dispersion forces (such as the Lennard-Jones potential)
which is also short ranged owing to the $r^{-6}$ attractive interaction.
However some systems have much longer ranged interactions. Notable here
are systems of charged particles which interact via a Coulomb potential.
The long ranged nature of the Coulomb potential (which decays like
$r^{-1}$) means that charged systems often do not have the same critical
exponents as the Ising model and fluid.

## Critical exponents

We consider now how the critical exponents, may be computed via the
coarse-graining procedure. In what follows we will refer only to the
behaviour of a single typical coarse grained variable, which we shall
denote $S(L)$. We suppose that $t$ is sufficiently small that $\xi \gg
L_\textrm{ min}$. Universality and scaling may be expressed in the claim
that, for *any* $L$ and $t$, scale factors $a(L)$ and $b(L)$ may be
found such that the probability distribution $p(S(L),t)$ can be written
in the form

$$p(S(L),t)=b(L)\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)
\label{eq:blocks}$$ where $\tilde{p}$ is a function unique to a
universality class. The role of the scale factors $a$ and $b$ is to
absorb the basic non-universal scales identified in
sec. [9.2](#sec:rgmethod){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:rgmethod"}. The critical exponents are implicit in the
$L$-dependence of these scale factors. Specifically one finds:

\begin{aligned}
a(L)&=&a_0L^{1/\nu} \\
b(L)&=&b_0L^{\beta/\nu}
\label{eq:scalefacs}
\end{aligned} where the amplitudes $a_0$ and $b_0$ are system specific
(non-universal) constants.

These results state that the critical exponents (in the form $1/\nu$ and
$\beta/\nu$) characterize the ways in which the configuration spectrum
evolves under coarse-graining. Consider, first the exponent ratio
$\beta/\nu$. Precisely at the critical point, there is only one way in
which the coarse-grained configurations change with $L$: the overall
scale of the coarse-grained variable (the black-white contrast in our
grey scale representation) is eroded with increasing $L$. Thus the
configurations of coarse-graining length $L_1$ match those of a larger
coarse-graining length $L_2$ only if the variable scale in the latter
configurations is amplified. The required amplification follows from
eqns. [\[eq:blocks\]](#eq:blocks){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:blocks"}
and [\[eq:scalefacs\]](#eq:scalefacs){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:scalefacs"}: it is

$$\frac{b(L_2)}{b(L_1)}=\left(\frac{L_2}{L_1}\right)^{\beta/\nu}\:.$$
The exponent ratio $\beta/\nu$ thus controls the rate at which the scale
of the ordering variable decays with increasing coarse-graining length.

Consider now the exponent $1/\nu$. For small but non-zero reduced
temperature (large but finite $\xi$) there is second way in which the
configuration spectrum evolves with $L$. As noted previously, coarse
graining reduces the ratio of correlation length to coarse-graining
length, and results in configurations with a less critical appearance.
More precisely, we see from
eq. [\[eq:blocks\]](#eq:blocks){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:blocks"} that increasing the coarse graining length from
$L_1$ to $L_2$ while keeping the reduced temperature constant has the
same effect on the configuration spectrum as keeping coarse-graining
length constant which amplifying the reduced temperature $t$ by a factor

$$\frac{a(L_2)}{a(L_1)}=\left(\frac{L_2}{L_1}\right)^{1/\nu}\:.$$ One
may think of the combination $a(L)t$ as a measure of the effective
reduced temperature of the physical system viewed with resolution length
$L$. The exponent $1/\nu$ controls the rate at which the effective
reduced temperature flows with increasing coarse-graining length.

## Finite-size scaling {#sec:fss}

We can exploit the fact that the scale factors $a(L)$ and $b(L)$ depend
on critical exponents to estimate the values of these exponents using
computer simulation. Consider the average of the block variable $S(L)$.
Consideration of eq. [\[eq:blkvar\]](#eq:blkvar){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:blkvar"} shows that this is non other than the value of
the order parameter $Q$, measured over a block of side $L$. Thus from
the definition of an average

$$Q(L,t)=\bar {S}(L,t)=\int S(L)p(S(L),t)dS(L)$$ where $p(S(L))$ is the
probability distribution of $S(L)$.

Making use of the representation of
eq. [\[eq:blocks\]](#eq:blocks){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:blocks"}, we then have that

$$Q(L,t) = \int b(L)S(L)\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)dS(L)$$

To integrate this we need to change the integration variable from $S(L)$
to $b(L)S(L)$. We have $d(b(L)S(L))=b(L)dS(L)$ since $b(L)$ does not
fluctuate. Thus

\begin{aligned}
Q(L,t)    &=& b^{-1}(L)\int b(L)S(L)\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)d(b(L)S(L))\nonumber\\
       &=& b^{-1}(L)f(a(L)t)\nonumber\\
       &=& b_0L^{-\beta/\nu}f(a_0L^{1/\nu}t)
\end{aligned} where $f$ is a universal function (defined as the first
moment of $\tilde{p}(x,y)$ with respect to $y$).

The above results provide a method for determining the critical exponent
ratios $\beta/\nu$ and $1/\nu$ via computer simulations of near critical
systems. For instance, at the critical point ($t=0$) and for finite
block size, $Q(L,0)$ will not be zero (the $T$ at which Q vanishes for
finite $L$ is above the true $T_c$, cf.
sec [8.2](#sec:compsim){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:compsim"}).
However, we know that its value must vanish in the limit of infinite
$L$; it does so like

$$Q(L,0)=b_0L^{-\beta/\nu}f(0)\equiv Q_0L^{-\beta/\nu}$$

Thus by studying the critical point $L$ dependence of $Q$ we can
estimate $\beta/\nu$. A similar approach in which we study two block
sizes $L$, and tune $t$ separately in each case so that the results for
$QL^{\beta/\nu}$ are identical provides information on the value of
$1/\nu$.

# The renormalisation group: effective coupling viewpoint

Let us begin by returning to our fundamental equation (eq.
[\[eq:probs\]](#eq:probs){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:probs"}),
which we rewrite as

$$p = Z^{-1}e^{-{\cal H}}$$ where ${\cal H}\equiv E/k_BT$.

The first step is then to imagine that we generate, by a computer
simulation procedure for example, a sequence of configurations with
relative probability $\exp(-{\cal H})$. We next adopt some
coarse-graining procedure which produces from these original
configurations a set of coarse-grained configurations. We then ask the
question: what is the energy function ${\cal H}^\prime$ of the
coarse-grained variables which would produce these coarse-grained
configurations with the correct relative probability
$\exp(-{\cal H}^\prime)$? Clearly the form of ${\cal H}^\prime$ depends
on the form of ${\cal H}$ thus we can write symbolically

$${\cal H}^\prime=R({\cal H})$$

The operation $R$, which defines the coarse-grained configurational
energy in terms of the microscopic configurational energy function is
known as a renormalisation group transformation (RGT). What it does is
to replace a hard problem by a less hard problem. Specifically, suppose
that our system is near a critical point and that we wish to calculate
its large-distance properties. If we address this task by utilizing the
configurational energy and appealing to the basic machinery of
statistical mechanics set out in
eqs. [\[eq:probs\]](#eq:probs){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:probs"} and
 [\[eq:partition\]](#eq:partition){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:partition"}, the problem is hard. It is hard because the
system has fluctuations on all the (many) length scales intermediate
between the correlation length $\xi$ and the minimum length scale
$L_\textrm{
min}$.

However, the task may instead be addressed by tackling the
coarse-grained system described by the energy ${\cal H}^\prime$. The
large-distance properties of this system are the same as the
large-distance properties of the physical system, since coarse-graining
operation preserves large-scale configurational structure. In this
representation the problem is a little easier: while the $\xi$
associated with ${\cal H}^\prime$ is the same as the $\xi$ associated
with ${\cal H}$, the minimum length scale of ${\cal H}^\prime$ is bigger
than that of ${\cal H}$. Thus the statistical mechanics of
${\cal H}^\prime$ poses a not-quite-so-many-length-scale problem, a
problem which is effectively a little less critical and is thus a little
easier to solve. The benefits accruing from this procedure may be
amplified by repeating it. Repeated application of $R$ will eventually
result in a coarse- grained energy function describing configurations in
which the $\xi$ is no bigger than the minimum length scale. The
associated system is far from criticality and its properties may be
reliably computed by any of a wide variety of approximation schemes.
These properties are the desired large-distance properties of the
physical system. As explicit reference to fluctuations of a given scale
is eliminated by coarse-graining, their effects are carried forward
implicitly in the parameters of the coarse-grained energy.

In order to setup the framework for a simple illustrative example, let
is return to the lattice Ising model for which the energy function
depended only on the product of nearest neighbour spins. The coefficient
of this product in the energy is the exchange coupling, $J$. In
principle, however, other kinds of interactions are also allowed; for
example, we may have a product of second neighbour spins with strength
$J_2$ or, perhaps, a product of four spins (at sites forming a square
whose side is the lattice spacing), with strength $J_3$. Such
interactions in a real magnet have their origin in the quantum mechanics
of the atoms and electrons and clearly depend upon the details of the
system. For generality therefore we will allow a family of exchange
couplings $J_1$,$J_2$,$J_3,\dots$, or $J_a, a =
1,2,\dots$ In reduced units, the equivalent coupling strengths are
$K_a =J_a/k_BT$. Their values determine uniquely the energy for any
given configuration.[^2]

Now consider the coarse-graining procedure. Let us suppose that this
procedure takes the form of a 'majority rule' operation in which the new
spins are assigned values $+1$ or $-1$ according to the signs of the
magnetic moments of the blocks with which they are associated. The new
energy function ${\cal H}^\prime$ will be expressible in terms of some
new coupling strengths $K^\prime$ describing the interactions amongst
the new spin variables (and thus, in effect, the interactions between
blocks of the original spin variables). The RGT simply states that these
new couplings depend on the old couplings: $K_1^\prime$ is some function
$f_1$ of all the original couplings, and generally

$$K^\prime_a=f_a(K_1,K_2,\dots) =f_a({\bf K}),~~~~ a= 1, 2,\dots
\label{eq:rgt}$$ where **K** is shorthand for the set $K_1, K_2,\dots$

## A simple example

This example illustrates how one can perform the RG transformation
([\[eq:rgt\]](#eq:rgt){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:rgt"})
directly, without recourse to a 'sequence of typical configurations'.
The calculation involves a very crude approximation which has the
advantage that it simplifies the subsequent analysis.

![Coarse graining by decimation. The spins on the original lattice are
divided into two sets $\{s^\prime\}$ and $\{\tilde{s}\}$. The
$\{s^\prime\}$ spins occupy a lattice whose spacing is twice that of the
original. The effective coupling interaction between the $\{s^\prime\}$
spins is obtained by performing the configurational average over the
$\{\tilde{s}\}$ ](Figs/rglat.pdf){#fig:rglat width="6.3cm"}

Consider an Ising model in two dimensions, with only nearest neighbour
interactions as shown in fig. [19](#fig:rglat){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:rglat"}. We have divided the spins into two sets, the
spins $\{s^\prime\}$ form a square lattice of spacing $2$, the others
being denoted by $\{\tilde{s}\}$. One then defines an effective energy
function ${\cal H^\prime}$ for the $s^\prime$ spins by performing an
average over all the possible arrangements of the $\tilde{s}$ spins

$$\exp(-{\cal H}^\prime)=\sum_{\{\tilde {s}\}} \exp(-{\cal H}).
\label{eq:decimate}$$

This particular coarse-graining scheme is called 'decimation' because a
certain fraction (not necessarily one-tenth!) of spins on the lattice is
eliminated. This formulation of a new energy function realizes two basic
aims of the RG method: the long-distance physics of the 'original'
system, described by ${\cal H}$, is contained in that of the 'new'
system, described by ${\cal H}^\prime$ (indeed the partition functions
are the same as one can see by summing both sides over $s^\prime$) and
the new system is further from critically because the ratio of $\xi$ to
lattice spacing ('minimum length scale') has been reduced by a factor of
$1/2$ (the ratio of the lattice spacings of the two systems). We must
now face the question of how to perform the configuration sum in
eq. [\[eq:decimate\]](#eq:decimate){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:decimate"}. This cannot in general be done exactly, so we
must resort to some approximation scheme. The particular approximation
which we invoke is the high temperature series expansion which was
touched upon in sec. [7](#sec:series){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:series"}. In its simplest mathematical form, since
${\cal H}$ contains a factor $1/k_BT$, it involves the expansion of
$\exp(-{\cal H})$ as a power series:

$$\exp(-{\cal H}/k_BT)=1-{\cal H}/k_BT +\frac{1}{2!}({\cal H}/k_BT)^2+.....$$

We substitute this expansion into the right hand side of
eq. [\[eq:decimate\]](#eq:decimate){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:decimate"} and proceed to look for terms which depend on
the $s^\prime$ spins after the sum over the possible arrangements of the
$\tilde{s}$ spins is performed. This sum extends over all the possible
($\pm 1$) values of all the $\tilde{s}$ spins. The first term (the 1) in
the expansion of the exponential is clearly independent of the values of
the $s^\prime$ spins. The second term (${\cal H}$) is a function of the
$s^\prime$ spins, but gives zero when the sum over the $s^\prime$ spins
is performed because only a single factor of any $s^\prime$ ever
appears, and $+ 1 - 1 = 0$. The third term (${\cal H}^2/2$) does
contribute. If one writes out explicitly the form of ${\cal H}^2/2$ one
finds terms of the form
$K^2s_1^\prime\tilde{s}\tilde{s}s_2^\prime=K^2s_1^\prime s_2^\prime$,
where $s_1^\prime$ and $s_2^\prime$ denote two spins at nearest
neighbour sites on the lattice of $s^\prime$ spins and $\tilde{s}$ is
the spin (in the other set) which lies between them. Now, in the
corresponding expansion of the left hand side of
eq. [\[eq:decimate\]](#eq:decimate){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:decimate"}, we find terms of the form
$K^\prime s_1^\prime s_2^\prime$, where $K^\prime$ is the nearest
neighbour coupling for the $s^\prime$ spins. We conclude (with a little
more thought than we detail here) that

$$K^\prime=K^2
\label{eq:rgdec}$$

Of course many other terms and couplings are generated by the higher
orders of the high temperature expansion and it is necssary to include
these if one wishes reliable values for the critical temperature and
exponents, However, our aim here is to use this simple calculation to
illustrate the RG method. Let us therefore close our eyes, forget about
the higher order terms and show how the RGT
(eq. [\[eq:rgdec\]](#eq:rgdec){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:rgdec"}) can be used to obtain information on the phase
transition.

![Coupling flow under the decimation transformation described in the
text.](Figs/flow1.pdf){#fig:flow1 width="12.3cm"}

The first point to note is that that mathematically
eq. [\[eq:rgdec\]](#eq:rgdec){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:rgdec"}
has the fixed point $K^*= 1$; if $K= 1$ then the new effective coupling
$K^\prime$ has the same value $1$. Further, if $K$ is just larger than
$1$, then $K^\prime$ is larger than $K$, i.e. further away from $1$.
Similarly, if $K$ is less than $1$, $K^\prime$ is less than $K$. We say
that the fixed point is unstable: the flow of couplings under repeated
iteration of eq. [\[eq:rgdec\]](#eq:rgdec){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:rgdec"} is away from the fixed point, as illustrated in
fig. [20](#fig:flow1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:flow1"}. The
physical significance of this is as follows: suppose that the original
system is at its critical point so that the ratio of $\xi$ to lattice
spacing is infinite. After one application of the decimation
transformation, the effective lattice spacing has increased by a factor
of two, but this ratio remains infinite; the new system is therefore
also at its critical point. Within the approximations inherent in
eq. [\[eq:rgdec\]](#eq:rgdec){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:rgdec"}, the original system is an Ising model with
nearest neighbour coupling $K$ and the new system is an Ising model with
nearest neighbour coupling $K^\prime$. If these two systems are going to
be at a common critically, we must identify $K^\prime=
K$. The fixed point $K^*= 1$ is therefore a candidate for the critical
point $K_c$, where the phase transition occurs. This interpretation is
reinforced by considering the case where the original system is close
to, but not at, criticality. Then $\xi$ is finite and the new system is
further from critically because the ratio of $\xi$ to lattice spacing is
reduced by a factor of two. This instability of a fixed point to
deviations of $K$ from $K^*$ is a further necessary condition for its
interpretation as a critical point of the system. In summary then we
make the prediction

$$K_c=J/k_BT_c=1
\label{eq:Kc}$$

We can obtain further information about the behaviour of the system
close to its critical point. In order to do so, we rewrite the
transformation (eq. [\[eq:rgdec\]](#eq:rgdec){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:rgdec"}) in terms of the deviation of the coupling from
its fixed point value. A Taylor expansion of the function $K^\prime=K^2$
yields

\begin{aligned}
K^\prime &=& (K^*)^2 +(K-K^*)\left.\frac{\partial K^\prime}{\partial K}\right|_{K=K^*}+\frac{1}{2}(K-K^*)^2\left.\frac{\partial^2 K^\prime}{\partial K^2}\right|_{K=K^*}+\ldots\nonumber\\
K^\prime - K^* &=& 2 (K - K^*)+ (K - K^*)^2 
\end{aligned} where in the second line we have used the fact that the
first derivative evaluates to $2K^*=2$ and $(K^*)^2=K^*$.

For a system sufficiently close to its critical temperature the final
term can be neglected. The deviation of the coupling from its fixed
point (critical) value is thus bigger for the new system than it is for
the old by a factor of two. This means that the reduced temperature is
also bigger by a factor of two:

$$t^\prime= 2t$$

But $\xi$ (in units of the appropriate lattice spacing) is smaller by a
factor of $1/2$:

$$\xi^\prime= \xi/2$$

Thus, when we double $t$, we halve $\xi$, implying that

$$\xi\propto t^{-1}$$

for $T$ close to $T_c$. Thus we see that the RGT predicts scaling
behaviour with calculable critical exponents. In this simple calculation
we estimate the critical exponent $\nu=1$ for the square lattice Ising
model. This prediction is actually in agreement with the exactly
established value. The agreement is fortuitous- the prediction in
Eq. refeq:Kc for $K_c$, is larger than the exactly established value by
a factor of more than two. In order to obtain reliable estimates more
sophisticated and systematic methods must be used.

The crude approximation in the calculation above produced a
transformation, eq. [\[eq:rgdec\]](#eq:rgdec){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:rgdec"}, involving only the nearest neighbour coupling,
with the subsequent advantages of simple algebra. We pay a penalty for
this simplicity in two ways: the results obtained for critical
properties are in rather poor agreement with accepted values, and we
gain no insight into the origin of universality.

## Universality and scaling

In order to expose how universality can arise, we should from the start
allow for several different kinds of coupling $J_a$, and show how the
systems with *different* $J_a$ can have the *same* critical behaviour.

![General flow in coupling space](Figs/flow2.pdf){#fig:flow2
width="10.3cm"}

Fig. [21](#fig:flow2){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:flow2"} is a
representation of the space of all coupling strengths $K_a$ in the
energy function ${\cal H}/k_BT$. This is of course actually a space of
infinite dimension, but representing three of these, as we have done,
enables us to illustrate all the important aspects. First let us be
clear what the points in this space represent. Suppose we have some
magnetic material which is described by a given set of exchange
constants $J_1,J_2,J_3.....$ As the temperature $T$ varies, the coupling
strengths $K_a=J_a/k_BT$ trace out a straight line, or ray, from the
origin of the space in the direction ($J_1,J_2,J_3 ....$ ). Points on
this ray close to the origin represent this magnet at high temperatures,
and conversely points far from the origin represent the magnet at low
temperatures. The critical point of the magnet is represented by a
specific point on this ray, $K_a=
J_a/k_BT, a= 1,2,\dots$ The set of critical points on all of the
possible rays forms a *surface*, the critical surface. Formally, it is
defined by the set of all possible models (of the Ising type) which have
infinite $\xi$. It is shown schematically as the shaded surface in
fig. [21](#fig:flow2){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:flow2"}. (In
the figure it is a two-dimensional surface; more generally it has one
dimension less than the full coupling constant space, dividing all
models into high and low tempera- ture phases.)

Our immediate goal then is to understand how the RGT can explain why
different physical systems near this critical surface have the same
behaviour. Let us turn now to the schematic representation of the RG
flow in fig. [21](#fig:flow2){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:flow2"}. Suppose we start with a physical system, with
coupling strengths $K_a,  a= 1,2, \dots$. What the RGT does is generate
a new point in the figure, at the coupling strengths
$K_a^{(1)}=f_a({\bf K})$; these are the couplings appearing in the
effective energy function describing the coarse-grained system. If we
repeat the transformation, the new energy function has coupling
strengths $K_a^{(2)}=f_a({\bf K})$. Thus repeated application of the
transformation generates a flow of points in the figure: ${\bf K\to
K^{(1)}\to\dots\to K^{(n)}}$ where the superscript ($n$) labels the
effective couplings after $n$ coarse-graining steps. if the change in
coarse-graining scale is $b$ ($> 1$) at each step, the total change in
coarse-graining scale is $b^n$ after $n$ steps. In the process,
therefore, the ratio of $\xi$ to coarse-graining scale is reduced by a
factor of $b^{-n}$. The dots in
fig. [21](#fig:flow2){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:flow2"}
identify three lines of RG flow starting from three systems differing
only in their temperature. (The flow lines are schematic but display the
essential features revealed in detailed calculations.)

Consider first the red dots which start from the nearest neighbour Ising
model at its critical point. The ratio of $\xi$ to coarse-graining scale
is reduced by a factor b at each step, but, since it starts infinite, it
remains infinite after any finite number of steps. In this case we can
in principle generate an unbounded number of dots,
${\bf K^{(1)}, K^{(2)},\dots,K^{(n)}}$, all of which lie in the critical
surface. The simplest behaviour of such a sequence as $n$ increases is
to tend to a limit, $K^*$, say. In such a case

$$K^*_a=f_a(K^*)~~~~ a= 1,2 .....$$

This point ${\bf K^*} \equiv K_1^*, K_2^*, \dots$ is therefore a *fixed
point* which lies in the critical surface.

By contrast, consider the same magnet as before, now at temperature $T$
just greater than $T_c$, its couplings $K_a$, will be close to the first
red dot (in fact they will be slightly smaller) and so will the
effective couplings $K_a^{(1)},K_2^{(2)},\dots$ of the corresponding
coarse-grained systems. The new flow will therefore appear initially to
follow the red dots towards the same fixed point. However, the flow must
eventually move away from the fixed point because each coarse-graining
now produces a model further from criticality. The resulting flow is
represented schematically by one set of black dots. The other set of
black dots shows the expected flow starting from the same magnet
slightly below its critical temperature.

We are now in a position to understand both universality and scaling
within this framework. We will suppose that there exists a single fixed
point in the critical surface which sucks in all flows starting from a
point in that surface. Then any system at its critical point will
exhibit large-length scale physics (large-block spin behaviour)
described by the single set of fixed point coupling constants. The
uniqueness of this limiting set of coupling constants is the essence of
critical point universality. It is, of course, the algebraic counterpart
of the unique limiting spectrum of coarse-grained configurations,
discussed in sec [9.5](#sec:unipics){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:unipics"}. Similarly the scale-invariance of the critical
point configuration spectrum (viewed on large enough length scales) is
expressed in the invariance of the couplings under iteration of the
transformation (after a number of iterations large enough to secure
convergence to the fixed point).

To understand the behaviour of systems near but not precisely at
critically we must make a further assumption (again widely justified by
explicit studies). The flow line stemming from any such system will, we
have argued, be borne towards the fixed point before ultimately
deviating from it after a number of iterations large enough to expose
the system's noncritical character. We assume that (as indicated
schematically in the streams of red and blue lines in
fig. [21](#fig:flow2){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:flow2"}) the
deviations lie along a single line through the fixed point, the
direction followed along this line differing according to the sign of
the temperature deviation $T-T_c$. Since any two sets of coupling
constants on the line (on the same side of the fixed point) are related
by a suitable coarse-graining operation, this picture implies that the
large-length-scale physics of all near- critical systems differs only in
the matter of a length scale. This is the essence of near-critical point
universality.

**Phase transitions: Problems**

Although you should try all of these questions, some of them are
deliberately quite challenging. If you don't get very far with some,
don't worry. We'll be going over them in problems classes, so you can
just regard them as worked examples.

1.  **Existence of a phase transition in $d=2$.**

    (Straightforward) In lectures it was argued that no long ranged
    order occurs at finite-temperatures in a one dimensional system
    because of the presence of domain walls. Were macroscopic domain
    walls to exist in two dimensions at finite temperature, they would
    similarly destroy long ranged order and prevent a phase transition.
    By calculating the free energy of a 2D domain wall for an Ising
    lattice, show that domain walls do not in fact exist for
    sufficiently low $T$.

    (*Hint: Model the domain wall as a non-reversing $N$-step random
    walk on the lattice and find an expression for its energy and -from
    the number of random walk configurations- its entropy.*)

2.  **Correlation Length**

    (Challenging) For a 1D Ising model, show that the correlation
    between the spins at sites $i$ and $j$, is

    $$\langle s_i s_j\rangle =\sum_m p_m(-1)^m$$ where $m$ is the number
    of domain walls between $i$ and $j$ and $p_m$ is the probability of
    finding $m$ domain walls between them.

    Hence show that when $R_{ij}=|i-j|a$ is large (with $a$ the lattice
    spacing) and the temperature is small, that

    $$\langle s_i s_j\rangle =\exp(-R_{ij}/\xi)$$ with $\xi=a/2p$ and
    $p$ the probability of finding a domain wall on a bond.

    *Hint: In the second part note that $p_m$ is given by a binomial
    distribution because there is a probability $p$ of each bond
    containing a domain wall and $(1-p)$ that it doesn't. What special
    type of distribution does $p_m$ tend to when $p$ is small (as occurs
    at low $T$)?*

3.  **A model fluid**

    (Straightforward) The van der Waals (vdW) equation of state (recall
    PH10002) is essentially a mean field theory for fluids. It relates
    the pressure and the volume of a fluid to the temperature:

    $$\left(P+\frac{a}{V^2}\right)(V-b)=N_Ak_BT$$ where $a$ and $b$ are
    constants and $N_A$ is Avogadro's number.

    The critical point of a fluid corresponds to the point at which the
    isothermal compressibility diverges, that is

    $$\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_T=0$$ Additionally, one
    finds that isotherms of $P$ versus $V$ exhibit a point of inflection
    at the critical point, that is

    $$\left(\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial V^2}\right)_T=0$$

    - Use these two requirements to show that the critical point of the
      vdW fluid is located at

      $$V_c=3b, ~~~ P_c=\frac{a}{27b^2},~~~ N_AK_BT_c=\frac{8a}{27b}$$

    - Hence show that when written in terms of reduced variables

      $$p=\frac{P}{P_c}, ~~~~ v=\frac{V}{V_c} ~~~~ t=\frac{T}{T_c}$$

      the equation takes the form

      $$\left(p+\frac{3}{v^2}\right)(v-\frac{1}{3})=\frac{8t}{3}$$

    - Use a graph-plotting program such as "Excel" to plot a selection
      of isotherms close to the critical temperature (you will need to
      choose suitable units for your axes). Plot also the gradient and
      second derivative of P vs V on the critical isotherm and confirm
      numerically that it exhibits a point of inflection at the critical
      pressure and temperature.

    - Obtain the value of the critical exponent $\gamma$ of the vdW
      model and confirm that it takes a mean-field value.

4.  **Mean field theory of the Ising model heat capacity**

    (Straightforward) Using results derived in lectures, obtain an
    expression for the mean energy $\langle E\rangle$ of the Ising model
    in zero field, within the simplest mean field approximation $\langle
      s_is_j\rangle=\langle s_i\rangle\langle s_j\rangle=m^2$. Hence
    show that for $H=0$ the heat capacity $\partial \langle
      E\rangle/\partial T$ has the behaviour

    \begin{aligned}
    C_H=& 0 ~~~~ T>T_c\\
    C_H=& 3Nk_B/2 ~~~~ T\le T_c
    \end{aligned}

5.  **Magnetisation and fluctuations**

    (Slightly tricky) A system of spins on a lattice, has, in the
    absence of an applied field, a Hamiltonian ${\cal H}$. In the
    presence of a field $h$ the Hamiltonian becomes
    $$\tilde {\cal H}={\cal H}-hM$$ where $M$ is the total magnetisation
    and $h$ is the magnetic field. By considering the partition function
    $Z(T,h)$ and its relationship to the free energy $F$ show that in
    general

    $$\langle M \rangle=-\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial h}\right)_T$$

    Show also that the variance of the magnetisation fluctuations is

    $$\langle M^2\rangle-\langle M\rangle^2=-k_BT\left(\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial h^2}\right)_T$$

    (*Hint: This is an important standard derivation found in many text
    books on Statistical Mechanics. You will need to differentiate $F$
    (twice) and use the product and chain rules.*)

6.  **Spin-1 Ising model**

    (Straightforward) A set of spins on a lattice of coordination number
    $q$ can take values $(-1,0,1)$, as opposed to just $(-1,1)$ as in
    the spin-1/2 Ising model. The Hamiltonian is

    $${\cal H}=-J\sum_{<ij>}s_is_j + h\sum_i s_i$$

    Find the partition function and hence show that in the mean field
    approximation, the magnetisation per site obeys

    $$m=\frac{2\sinh[\beta(Jqm+h)]}{2\cosh[\beta(Jqm+h)]+1}$$

    and find the critical temperature $T_c$ at which the net
    magnetisation vanishes.

7.  **Transfer Matrix.**

    (Straightforward strategy but some lengthy algebra required)

    Verify the calculation of the free energy of the 1D periodic chain
    Ising model in a field outlined in lectures using the Transfer
    Matrix method.

    Use your results to show that the spontaneous magnetisation is:

    $$m=\frac{\sinh \beta H}{\sqrt{\sinh^2\beta H+\exp{-4\beta J}}}$$
    Comment on the value of $m$ in zero field.

    (*Hint: Follow the prescription given in lectures. Depending on your
    approach you may need to use the trigonometrical identities
    $\cosh^2x-\sinh^2x=1$, $\cosh(2x)=2\cosh^2x-1$.*)

8.  **Lattice gas model** (Straightforward). Check the claim, made in
    lectures that the "Hamiltonian" of the Lattice Gas model in the
    grand canonical ensemble

    $${\cal H}_{LG}=-\epsilon\sum_{<i,j>}c_ic_j -\mu\sum_ic_i$$

    is transformed to that of the Ising model by means of the change of
    variable

    $$s_i=2c_i-1;~~~~ J=\frac{\epsilon}{4}~~~~
    h=\frac{\epsilon q+2\mu}{4}$$

    (*Hint: Note that when doing sums over bonds $\sum_{\langle
        i,j\rangle}$ for a lattice of coordination $q$ there are $q/2$
    bonds per site since each bond is shared between two sites.*)

9.  **Landau theory**

    Check and complete the Landau theory calculations, given in
    lectures, for the critical exponents $\gamma=1$ and $\alpha=0$ of
    the Ising model. For the latter, you should first prove the result

    $$C_H =-T\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial T^2}$$ starting from the
    classical theormodynamics expression for changes in the free energy
    of a magnet $dF=-SdT-MdH$.

    (*Hint: If you get stuck with the proof see standard thermodynamics
    text books. To get the susceptibility exponent in Landau theory add
    a term $-Hm$ to the Hamiltonian.*)

10. **Scaling laws**

    (Straightforward.)Using the generalised homogeneous form for the
    free energy given in lectures, take appropriate derivatives to find
    the relationships to the critical exponents:

    $$\beta=\frac{1-b}{a}; ~~ \gamma=\frac{2b-1}{a};~~ \delta= \frac{b}{1-b}; ~~~ \alpha=2-\frac{1}{a}.$$

    Hence derive the scaling laws among the critical exponents:

    \begin{aligned}
    \alpha+\beta(\delta+1)=2 \\
    \alpha+2\beta+\gamma=2\\
    %\gamma=\beta(\delta-1)
    \end{aligned} (*Hint: For the heat capacity exponent $\alpha$ use
    the result from problem 9:
    $C_H=-T\left(\frac{\partial^2F}{\partial T^2}\right)_{h=0}$*)

11. **Renormalization Group transformation for the 1D Ising model**

    (Challenging.) Consider a 1D Ising model of $N$ spins in zero field
    given by the Hamiltonian

    $${\cal H}_I/k_BT=-K\sum_{<ij>}s_is_j -\sum_iC$$ where a background
    term is included because even if set zero initially, it will be
    generated by an RG transformation.

    - A renormalisation is to be implemented with a scale factor $b=2$.
      By partially performing the sum in the partition function over the
      spins on the even numbered lattice sites, show that the partially
      summed partition function can be written

      $$Z=\sum_{s_1,s_3,s_5...}\prod_{i=2,4,6...} [\exp
      [K(s_{i-1}+s_{i+1})+2C] + \exp[-K(s_{i-1}+s_{i+1})+2C]$$

    - Next, relabel the remaining (odd numbered) spins so that they are
      numbered consecutively eg by an index $j$ (this is a matter of
      convenience only). Then cast this partially summed partition
      function in a form that makes it look the same as that for an
      Ising model with $N/2$ spins. i.e. require that $Z^\prime$ has the
      form

      $$Z=\sum_{\{s\}}\prod_{j=1}^{N/2}\exp[K^\prime s_js_{j+1}+C^\prime]\:,$$
      for all $s_j,s_{j+1}=\pm 1$.

      Hence show that the effective coupling $K^\prime$, and background
      constant $C^\prime$ of the renormalised system are related to
      those of the underlying Hamiltonian by

      \begin{aligned}
      \exp(K^\prime+C^\prime) &=& \exp(2C)[\exp(2K)+\exp(-2K)] \\
      \exp(-K^\prime+C^\prime) &=& 2\exp(2C)
      \end{aligned}

    - Use these results to show that the effective coupling flows under
      the renormalization according to:

      $$K^\prime = (1/2)\ln (\cosh 2K)$$

      Does this flow drive the effective coupling to the low or high
      temperature fixed point?

    - Finally show that the partition function transforms under the RG
      as

      $$Z(K,N)=2^{N/2}\exp(NK^\prime/2)Z(K^\prime,N/2)$$

    *Note. The above is a hard question, which we'll go over this in
    detail in a problems class. So if you don't make much progress,
    don't worry, just treat it as a worked example.*

12. **RG flow of the free energy**

    (Straightforward) An alternative RG equation for the effective
    coupling in the 1D Ising model is

    $$K = (1/2)\cosh^{-1}(\exp 2K^\prime)$$ which is the inverse of the
    transformation found in the previous question. This transformation
    thus drives the system from small effective coupling (high
    temperature) to high effective coupling (low temperature).

    Under the transformation, the free energy density transforms like

    $$\beta f(K)=(1/2)\beta f(K^\prime)-(1/2)\ln 2-K^\prime/2\:.$$

    - Use these findings to iteratively calculate the free energy
      density of the Ising model at low temperatures, starting from the
      high temperature limit.

      *Hint: Start with a very low coupling eg. $K^\prime=0.01$, and
      show that because interactions between spins are negligible,
      $\beta f(K^\prime)\approx
      -\ln 2$. Then iterate the RG equations above $8$ or so times to
      generate a sequence of $K$ and $\beta f(K)$ values.*

    - Compare your results for each iteration with the exact results for
      the free energy density of the 1D Ising model obtained in
      lectures.

[^1]: Exercise: try to derive these relationships

[^2]: We note that it is not only useful to allow for arbitrary kinds of
    interactions: if we wish to repeat the transformation several
    (indeed many) times, it is also necessary because even if we start
    with only the nearest neighbour coupling in ${\cal H}$ the
    transformation will in general produce others in ${\cal H}^\prime$.
