Typically (but not exclusively) these are **thermal fluctuations**. This means that **entropy** and not only the energy from the interactions plays a key role.\n\nThis is because soft matter systems are typically composed of **many microscopic constituents** in contact with an **environment**. The appropriate description of the **macroscopic state** of such systems is therefore **statistical** and uses the language of **statistical mechanics**. The relevant **energy**, therefore, is the free energy of the statistical ensemble representative of the system under consideration. For example, in the canonical ensemble, this is the Helmholtz free energy\n\n$$F = U-TS$$\n\nwhere $U$ is the internal energy, $T$ the temperature and $S$ is the entropy of the system.

Unlike traditional systems where energy minimization dominates, in soft matter, entropy plays a crucial role in determining the structure, dynamics, and behavior of the system.

It is kept together by covalent chemical bonds. Different architectures exist: linear-chain homopolymers, (block) copolymers, starpolymers, dendrimers etc. We concentrate on linear chains, which also represents the main building block of the other structures. Examples: polyethylene, cellulose, DNA, proteins. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-04.jpg?height=415&width=329&top_left_y=232&top_left_x=235){width=\"212\"} ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-04.jpg?height=421&width=332&top_left_y=229&top_left_x=656)\n-   A **surfactant** (SURFace ACTive AgeNT) is a special kind of molecule. In the simplest case, it has a water-loving (hydrophilic) 'head group', and a water-hating (hydrophobic) 'tail'. Above a certain concentration they spontaneously selfassemble into a wide variety of structures, the simplest being a spherical micelle. They associate by (rather weak) physical interactions ('association colloids'). Examples: ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-04.jpg?height=426&width=752&top_left_y=1009&top_left_x=1086){width=\"334\"} Sodium Dodecylsulfate (SDS), lipids.\n\nNote: In general, when in bulk form, the substance forming colloidal particles is quite insoluble in the dispersion medium. However, when the bulk material is broken down into very small pieces it can be dispersed. Such a system is called a lyophobic ('solvent-avoiding') colloid. Some colloidal particles themselves consist of polymers or surfactant assemblies which can easily be dispersed and are thus labelled lyophilic ('solvent-loving'). Mostly when we talk about \"colloids\", we do not care about the 'internal' structure of the particles, while we are in general interested in the structure of polymers or surfactant assemblies.\n\n-   Many liquid-state soft matter system, particular colloids and polymers can be cooled to very low temperatures without crystallizing. At these low temperatures, the typical relaxation times of the particles becomes very high, even on experimental time scales. Thus the liquid-like disorder is \"frozen-in\" and we refer to the system as a glass.\n\n### Macromolecules: principal distinguishing features\n\n#### Size Range ( $1 \\mathrm{~nm} \\lesssim R \\lesssim 1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ )\n\nLower limit (about 1 nm ): This ensures that the size of the dispersed particles is much larger than the size of the molecules forming the dispersion medium. This not only distinguishes colloids from ordinary (true) solutions, but also results in a 'welldefined' interface between the particles and the surrounding medium. Furthermore, (most of the time) this allows us both, to treat the dispersion medium as a continuum and to avoid quantum mechanics.\n\n#### Upper limit (about $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ ):\n\n-   Balance of thermal and potential energy:\n\nEvery particle has thermal energy $\\mathrm{E}_{\\text {therm }}=(3 / 2) k_{B} T$ and potential energy $E_{\\mathrm{pot}}=m g z=(4 \\pi / 3) R^{3} \\Delta \\rho g z$, where $z$ is a characteristic length, e.g. $R$, and $\\Delta \\rho$ is the density difference between the particle and the dispersion medium.

This can be modelled as a random (drunk!) walk of $N$ steps of length $b$ with a random angle between the individual steps. How far from the origin does the particle get in N steps? ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-06.jpg?height=415&width=313&top_left_y=882&top_left_x=868)\n\nAverage over many tries (or many particles):\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\underline{R}>=\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\left\\langle\\underline{r}_{j}\\right\\rangle=0 \\quad \\text { since } \\underline{r}_{j}\\right. \\text { can be in any direction }\n$$\n\nMean square displacement:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&<\\underline{R}^{2}>=<\\underline{R} \\cdot \\underline{R}>=<\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\underline{r}_{j} \\cdot \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\underline{r}_{k}>=\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N}\\left\\langle\\underline{r}_{j} \\cdot \\underline{r}_{k}>\\right. \\\\\n& j=k:<\\underline{r}_{j} \\cdot \\underline{r}_{k}>=\\left\\langle\\underline{r}_{j}^{2}>=b^{2}\\right. \\\\\n& j \\neq k:<\\underline{r}_{j} \\cdot \\underline{r}_{k}>=b^{2}<\\cos \\theta>=0 \\quad \\text { since any } \\theta \\text { in } 0 \\leqq \\theta \\leqq 2 \\pi \\\\\n&<\\underline{R}^{2}>=\\sum_{j=1}^{N} b^{2}=N b^{2} \\propto t \\quad \\text { since time } t \\propto N\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn fact a more careful treatment shows that the root mean-square displacement $<\\underline{R}^{2}>1 / 2$ $=\\sqrt{2 D t} \\propto \\sqrt{t}$ where for spherical particles the diffusion constant $D=k_{B} T / 6 \\pi \\eta R$, where $R$ is the particle radius.\n\nExample: Consider uncharged protein spheres in water ( $\\rho$ protein $=1.35 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ ) at $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}(\\eta$ $=1 \\mathrm{Ps})$.

In the limit of a large number of random steps, one finds that in 1 dimension this probability is given by\n\n$$\nP_{N}(x) d x=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi<(\\Delta x)^{2}>}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\langle x\\rangle)^{2}}{\\left.2<(\\Delta x)^{2}\\right\\rangle}} d x \\quad \\text { A 1d Gaussian distribution }\n$$\n\nThis has mean $\\langle x\\rangle=0$ and variance $\\left\\langle(\\Delta x)^{2}\\right\\rangle \\equiv \\sigma^{2}>0$.\n\nIn 3 dimensions, the corresponding relation is\n\n$$\nP(\\underline{r}) d \\underline{r}=\\frac{1}{\\left(2 \\pi \\sigma^{2}\\right)^{3 / 2}} e^{-r^{2} / 2 \\sigma^{2}} d \\underline{r}\n$$\n\nThe distribution has its first moment at the origin and second moment\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\underline{r}^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\underline{r}^{2} P(\\underline{r}) d \\underline{r}=\\frac{1}{\\left(2 \\pi \\sigma^{2}\\right)^{3 / 2}} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin \\theta d \\theta \\int_{0}^{2 \\pi} d \\phi \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{4} e^{-r^{2} / 2 \\sigma^{2}} d r=3 \\sigma^{2}\n$$\n\nThis latter result can also be obtained in a direct calculation, considering $N$ random steps in x direction, $N$ in y direction and $N$ in z direction with $\\left\\langle x^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle y^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle z^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\sigma^{2}$ and thus $\\left\\langle\\underline{r}^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle x^{2}\\right\\rangle+\\left\\langle y^{2}\\right\\rangle+\\left\\langle z^{2}\\right\\rangle=3 \\sigma^{2}=N b^{2}$\n\n### Large interface between dispersed phase and dispersion medium\n\nIn commercial terms it is often highly desirable to produce soft matter systems whose (chemical) properties lie somewhere between those of bulk and molecularly dispersed systems, i.e. whose properties are not just the sum of the contributions from the molecules in the bulk phases. To achieve this, a significant proportion of the molecules should lie within or close to the particle-medium interface, which is equivalent to a large surface-to-volume ratio ('microheterogeneous' systems, link to surface science). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-09.jpg?height=903&width=1063&top_left_y=321&top_left_x=496)\n\nOften colloidal particles have a spherical shape, which allows for a relatively small surface-to-volume ratio, but they may also be ellipsoids (prolate or oblate), discs, rods, fibres, random coils etc.\n\n### Making measurements: Scattering experiments\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-09.jpg?height=456&width=1318&top_left_y=1710&top_left_x=238)\n\nThe most commonly used experimental tool for studying soft matter systems is scattering. The experiment may utilize light, neutrons or X-rays as the scattering probe. Due to the random arrangement of particles, a random diffraction pattern is observed. This fluctuates as particles move in Brownian motion. The scattered intensity as measured under a certain scattering angle will thus also fluctuate with time (given the detector area is small enough).","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nMost of the matter around us does not simply fit within the idealised pictures of crystallines solids or simple liquids: examples include colloids, polymers, surfactants, liquid crystals, foams, gels, and biological materials such as proteins, DNA, and cell membranes. \n\nThis means that cellular **life itself **(the very constituents that make us) obeys to principles that go beyond the standard patters of conventional solid-state physics.\n\n\nThis branch of physics is called **soft condensed matter physics**, or **macromolecular** physics, or the physics of **complex fluids**.\n\nWhile we often think about problems in physics as a matter of energy minimisation, in soft-matter physics a key role is played by the **fluctuations**.

We can calculate the displacement due to Brownian motion and sedimentation respectively as a function of the particle radius $R$.\n\nFor Brownian motion, we have $\\left\\langle\\underline{R}^{2}\\right\\rangle^{1 / 2}=\\sqrt{2 D t}$ with $D=k_{B} T / 6 \\pi \\eta R$ For sedimentation, we have $v_{\\text {sed }}=2 R^{2} \\Delta \\rho g / 9 \\eta$ Hence we can make a plot of displacement versus particle radius.\n\n| R | $\\mathrm{D}\\left(20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$ | $\\left(\\left\\langle\\underline{R}^{2}\\right\\rangle\\right)^{1 / 2}$ after 1 h |   | $\\mathrm{v}_{\\text {sed }} \\times 1 \\mathrm{~h}$ |\n|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|\n| 1 nm | $2.1 \\cdot 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$ | $1230 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ | $>$ | 2.8 nm |\n| 10 nm | $2.1 \\cdot 10^{-11} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$ | $390 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ | $>$ | $0.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ |\n| 100 nm | $2.1 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$ | $123 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ | $>$ | $30 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ |\n| $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ | $2.1 \\cdot 10^{-13} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$ | $39 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ | $<$ | 3 mm |\n| $10 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ | $2.1 \\cdot 10^{-14} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$ | $12 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ | $<$ | 0.3 m |\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-07.jpg?height=855&width=1134&top_left_y=1047&top_left_x=493)\n\nMore generally we can write down equations which express the probability of finding a particle at a given vector displacement from its starting point. In the limit of a large number of random steps, one finds that in 1 dimension this probability is given by\n\n$$\nP_{N}(x) d x=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi<(\\Delta x)^{2}>}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\langle x\\rangle)^{2}}{\\left.2<(\\Delta x)^{2}\\right\\rangle}} d x \\quad \\text { A 1d Gaussian distribution }\n$$\n\nThis has mean $\\langle x\\rangle=0$ and variance $\\left\\langle(\\Delta x)^{2}\\right\\rangle \\equiv \\sigma^{2}>0$.\n\nIn 3 dimensions, the corresponding relation is\n\n$$\nP(\\underline{r}) d \\underline{r}=\\frac{1}{\\left(2 \\pi \\sigma^{2}\\right)^{3 / 2}} e^{-r^{2} / 2 \\sigma^{2}} d \\underline{r}\n$$\n\nThe distribution has its first moment at the origin and second moment\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\underline{r}^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\underline{r}^{2} P(\\underline{r}) d \\underline{r}=\\frac{1}{\\left(2 \\pi \\sigma^{2}\\right)^{3 / 2}} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin \\theta d \\theta \\int_{0}^{2 \\pi} d \\phi \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{4} e^{-r^{2} / 2 \\sigma^{2}} d r=3 \\sigma^{2}\n$$\n\nThis latter result can also be obtained in a direct calculation, considering $N$ random steps in x direction, $N$ in y direction and $N$ in z direction with $\\left\\langle x^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle y^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle z^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\sigma^{2}$ and thus $\\left\\langle\\underline{r}^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle x^{2}\\right\\rangle+\\left\\langle y^{2}\\right\\rangle+\\left\\langle z^{2}\\right\\rangle=3 \\sigma^{2}=N b^{2}$\n\n### Large interface between dispersed phase and dispersion medium\n\nIn commercial terms it is often highly desirable to produce soft matter systems whose (chemical) properties lie somewhere between those of bulk and molecularly dispersed systems, i.e. whose properties are not just the sum of the contributions from the molecules in the bulk phases. To achieve this, a significant proportion of the molecules should lie within or close to the particle-medium interface, which is equivalent to a large surface-to-volume ratio ('microheterogeneous' systems, link to surface science). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-09.jpg?height=903&width=1063&top_left_y=321&top_left_x=496)\n\nOften colloidal particles have a spherical shape, which allows for a relatively small surface-to-volume ratio, but they may also be ellipsoids (prolate or oblate), discs, rods, fibres, random coils etc.\n\n### Making measurements: Scattering experiments\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-09.jpg?height=456&width=1318&top_left_y=1710&top_left_x=238)\n\nThe most commonly used experimental tool for studying soft matter systems is scattering. The experiment may utilize light, neutrons or X-rays as the scattering probe. Due to the random arrangement of particles, a random diffraction pattern is observed. This fluctuates as particles move in Brownian motion. The scattered intensity as measured under a certain scattering angle will thus also fluctuate with time (given the detector area is small enough)."},"formats":{"live-html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"live-html","base-format":"html","extension-name":"live"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["/Users/phxnw/Dropbox/course-disordered-matter/quarto/_extensions/r-wasm/live/live.lua"],"toc":true,"output-file":"soft-matter_intro.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
