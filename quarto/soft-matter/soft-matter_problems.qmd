### Interaction of two charged colloidal spheres

Consider a colloidal particle of total charge $Q$ located at the origin, immersed in a solvent of permittivity $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r$. The solvent contains a symmetric electrolyte with two mobile ionic species:

-   Cations of charge $+ze$ and bulk concentration $n_0$,
-   Anions of charge $-ze$ and bulk concentration $n_0$.

1.  Show that The mean electrostatic potential $\phi(\mathbf{r})$ satisfies Poisson’s equation: $$
    \nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{1}{\varepsilon} \left[ z e\, n_+(\mathbf{r}) - z e\, n_-(\mathbf{r}) + Q \delta(\mathbf{r}) \right].
    $$

    Assuming the ions form an ideal gas in thermal equilibrium, their local densities follow Boltzmann distributions: $$
    n_+(\mathbf{r}) = n_0 \exp[-\beta z e\, \phi(\mathbf{r})], \qquad
    n_-(\mathbf{r}) = n_0 \exp[+\beta z e\, \phi(\mathbf{r})], $$ where $\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.

2.  Use these expressions to obtain the (simplified) *nonlinear Poisson–Boltzmann equation* : $$
    \nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{2 z e n_0}{\varepsilon} \sinh\big(\beta z e\, \phi(\mathbf{r})\big) - \frac{Q}{\varepsilon}\delta(\mathbf{r}).
    $$

3.  Find physical conditions to linearise the equation.

4.  Solve the resulting linear equation for spherical symmetry to obtain the screened Coulomb (Debye–Hückel) potential: $$
    \phi(r) = \frac{Q}{4\pi \varepsilon} \frac{e^{-\kappa r}}{r},
    \qquad \kappa^2 = \frac{2 n_0 z^2 e^2}{\varepsilon k_B T}.
    $$

The parameter $\kappa^{-1}$ is the Debye screening length, and the solution shows that ionic screening converts the long-range Coulomb potential into a short-range Yukawa potential.

## Solution

We start by considering a single colloidal particle of total charge $Q$ located at the origin, immersed in a solvent characterized by a permittivity $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r$. The solvent contains a symmetric electrolyte composed of two mobile ionic species: cations of charge $+ze$ and bulk concentration $n_0$, and anions of charge $-ze$ with the same bulk concentration $n_0$. The overall system is globally electroneutral in the bulk, so the net ionic charge far from the colloid is zero. The presence of the charged colloid generates an electrostatic potential $\phi(\mathbf{r})$ in the surrounding medium.

The mean electrostatic potential satisfies Poisson’s equation, which relates the divergence of the electric field to the local charge density. In this system, the total charge density consists of the fixed colloidal charge, represented by $Q \delta(\mathbf{r})$, and the contribution from the mobile ions, which depends on their local concentrations. This gives $$
\nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{1}{\varepsilon} \left[ z e\, n_+(\mathbf{r}) - z e\, n_-(\mathbf{r}) + Q \delta(\mathbf{r}) \right].
$$

To relate the ionic densities to the electrostatic potential, we assume the ions behave as an ideal gas in thermal equilibrium. Each ion experiences a potential energy proportional to its charge times the local potential, $U_\pm(\mathbf{r}) = \pm z e \phi(\mathbf{r})$. In equilibrium, the number density of each species follows the Boltzmann distribution, so the cation and anion densities are $$
n_+(\mathbf{r}) = n_0 \exp[-\beta z e\, \phi(\mathbf{r})], \qquad n_-(\mathbf{r}) = n_0 \exp[+\beta z e\, \phi(\mathbf{r})],
$$ where $\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse thermal energy. This captures the intuitive fact that cations are repelled by positive potentials and attracted to negative potentials, while anions behave oppositely.

Substituting these expressions for $n_+$ and $n_-$ into Poisson’s equation yields $$
\nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{1}{\varepsilon} \Big[ z e n_0 e^{-\beta z e \phi} - z e n_0 e^{\beta z e \phi} + Q \delta(\mathbf{r}) \Big].
$$ The difference of exponentials can be written as twice a hyperbolic sine, leading to the nonlinear Poisson–Boltzmann equation $$
\nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{2 z e n_0}{\varepsilon} \sinh\big(\beta z e\, \phi(\mathbf{r})\big) - \frac{Q}{\varepsilon}\delta(\mathbf{r}).
$$ This equation describes how the potential generated by the colloid is screened by the surrounding ions. The nonlinearity arises because the ionic response depends exponentially on the potential itself.

The equation can be linearized under the condition that the potential is small compared to the thermal voltage, specifically when $|\beta z e \phi(\mathbf{r})| \ll 1$. In this limit, the hyperbolic sine can be approximated by its argument

$$\sinh(\beta z e \phi) \approx \beta z e \phi.$$

The Poisson–Boltzmann equation then reduces to a **linear** differential equation

$$
\nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) - \kappa^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{Q}{\varepsilon} \delta(\mathbf{r}),
$$

where the inverse Debye length $\kappa$ is defined by

$$
\kappa^2 = \frac{2 n_0 z^2 e^2}{\varepsilon k_B T}.
$$

This linearized equation is known as the Debye–Hückel equation and describes the potential around a point charge in a screening medium.

This can be solved in Fourier space using the relations:

| Real space                      | Fourier space               |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| $f(\mathbf{r})$                 | $f(\mathbf{k})$             |
| $\nabla^2 f(\mathbf{r})$        | $-k^2 f(\mathbf{k})$        |
| $\delta(\mathbf{r})$            | $1$                         |
| $\dfrac{e^{-\kappa r}}{4\pi r}$ | $\dfrac{1}{k^2 + \kappa^2}$ |

This gives

$$
\phi(r) = \frac{Q}{4\pi \varepsilon} \frac{e^{-\kappa r}}{r}.
$$ At short distances ($r \ll \kappa^{-1}$), the potential reduces to the familiar Coulomb form, while at larger distances it decays exponentially due to ionic screening. The characteristic decay length $\kappa^{-1}$ is the Debye screening length, which increases with decreasing ionic strength and temperature. This solution illustrates how the electrolyte effectively screens the electrostatic interactions between colloidal particles, converting the long-range Coulomb potential into a short-range interaction that governs the stability and dynamics of colloidal suspensions.

**Note.** In the linearised regime, the Poisson-Boltzmann equation reads

$$
\nabla^2 \phi-\kappa^2 \phi=-\frac{Q}{\varepsilon} \delta(\mathbf{r})
$$

A similar equation exists in field theory for a massive scalar field $\Phi(\mathbf{r})$: it is the Klein-Gordon equation in Euclidean space

$$
\left(-\nabla^2+m^2\right) \Phi(\mathbf{r})=J(\mathbf{r})
$$

It is easy to identify the field the mass and the source with the respective static potential field, the Debye screening parameter and the point charge. The Yukawa potential is then simply the **propagator** (the Green's function).

### Second virial coefficient for depletion interactions

Consider a dilute suspension of spherical colloidal particles of radius $R_c$ in a solution of small ideal polymer coils of radius $R_p \ll R_c$. The polymers are non-adsorbing and behave as an ideal gas outside the colloids. The colloids interact via the **Asakura–Oosawa depletion potential** $U_{\rm AO}(r)$:

$$
U_{\rm AO}(r) =
\begin{cases}
\infty, & r < 2 R_c \\[2mm]
-\Pi\, V_{\rm overlap}(r), & 2 R_c \le r \le 2 R_c + 2 R_p \\[1mm]
0, & r > 2 R_c + 2 R_p
\end{cases}
$$

where $r$ is the center-to-center distance, $\Pi = n_p k_B T$ is the so called *osmotic pressure* of the polymer solution, and $V_{\rm overlap}(r)$ is the overlap volume of the depletion zones, given by

$$
V_{\text {overlap }}(r)=\frac{\pi\left(4 R_{\mathrm{eff}}+r\right)\left(2 R_{\mathrm{eff}}-r\right)^2}{12},
$$

with $R_{eff} = R_c+R_p$.

1.  Write the expression for the *second virial coefficient* $B_2$ in terms of the interaction potential:

    $$
     B_2 = -2 \pi \int_0^\infty \left( e^{-\beta U_{\rm AO}(r)} - 1 \right) r^2 dr
     $$

2.  Assuming the polymer-induced attraction is *weak* ($\beta |U_{\rm AO}(r)| \ll 1$) and that the polymers are much smaller than the colloids, expand the exponential to first order and simplify the integral.

3.  Express the resulting $B_2$ in terms of $R_c$, $R_p$, and the polymer osmotic pressure $\Pi$.

4.  Discuss qualitatively how $B_2$ depends on polymer concentration and size, and explain what a **negative** $B_2$ implies for colloidal aggregation.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Solution

The second virial coefficient $B_2$ measures the effective two-body contribution to the pressure of a dilute colloidal suspension, following the virial expansion. It is defined for a pairwise potential $U(r)$ as:

$$
B_2 = -2\pi \int_0^\infty \left( e^{-\beta U(r)} - 1 \right) r^2 dr.
$$

Here, $U(r) = U_{\mathrm{ AO}}(r)$ is the Asakura–Oosawa depletion potential.

1.  Rewrite $B_2$

    The AO potential has three regions:

    -   Hard-core region ($r < 2 R_c$), where $U = \infty \rightarrow e^{-\beta U} = 0$. The integrand becomes $-1$, giving contribution:

    $$
    B_2^{\mathrm HC} = -2\pi \int_0^{2R_c} (-1) r^2 dr = 2\pi \int_0^{2R_c} r^2 dr = \frac{16\pi}{3} R_c^3,
    $$

    which is just the hard-sphere contribution.

    -   Depletion region ($2R_c \le r \le 2R_c + 2 R_p$), where $U(r) = -\Pi V_{\mathrm overlap}(r)$.

    -   No interaction ($r > 2R_c + 2 R_p$), where $U = 0 \rightarrow e^{-\beta U} - 1 = 0$.

The overlap is written as (lecture notes) $$
V_{\text {overlap }}(r)=\frac{4 \pi}{3} R_d^3\left[1-\frac{3}{4} \frac{r}{R_d}+\frac{1}{16}\left(\frac{r}{R_d}\right)^3\right], \quad r \leq R_d=2R_c+2R_p
$$

and can be shown to be equivalent to

$$
V_{\text {overlap }}(r)=\frac{\pi\left(4 R_{\mathrm{eff}}+r\right)\left(2 R_{\mathrm{eff}}-r\right)^2}{12}
$$

So the integral reduces to contributions from $r < 2R_c$ (hard core) and $2R_c \le r \le 2R_c + 2R_p$ (depletion).

2.  Linearize the exponential. For weak polymer-induced attraction, $\beta |U| = \beta \Pi V_{\mathrm overlap} \ll 1$, we can expand:

$$
e^{-\beta U(r)} \approx 1 - \beta U(r) = 1 + \beta \Pi V_{\mathrm overlap}(r).
$$

Then the integrand in the depletion region becomes:

$$
-(e^{-\beta U} - 1) \approx -\beta \Pi V_{\mathrm overlap}(r).
$$

So the contribution to $B_2$ from the depletion region is:

$$
B_2^{\mathrm dep} = -2\pi \int_{2R_c}^{2R_c + 2R_p} \big( e^{-\beta U} - 1 \big) r^2 dr \approx -2\pi \beta \Pi \int_{2R_c}^{2R_c + 2R_p} V_{\mathrm overlap}(r) r^2 dr.
$$

3.  Express $B_2$ in terms of $R_c$, $R_p$, $\Pi$

Combining the hard-core and depletion contributions, the second virial coefficient is

$$
B_2 = \frac{16\pi}{3} R_c^3 - 2\pi \beta \Pi \int_{2R_c}^{2R_c + 2R_p} V_{\mathrm{overlap}}(r)\, r^2 dr
$$

We then calculate the second integral we just need to choose how to represent the overlap. We use the second expression above and leverage the fact that $R_p \ll R_c$ and that then the integral runs over $r=2R_C+x$ with $x\in[0,2R_p]$, so with $x$ clearly subleading

So, then

$$
4R_{\mathrm eff}+r = 6 R_c+4 R_p+x
$$

and

$$
2R_{\mathrm eff}-r = 2R_c+2R_p-2R_c-x= 2R_p-x
$$

So together

$$
V_{\mathrm overlap}(x) = \dfrac{\pi(6R_c+4R_p+x)(2R_p-x)^2}{12}
$$

dropping subleading contributions leads to $$
V_{\mathrm overlap}(x) \approx \dfrac{6\pi R_c(2R_p-x)^2}{12}
$$

Then, we rewrite 

$$\int_{2R_c}^{2R_c + 2R_p} V_{\mathrm{overlap}}(r)\, r^2 dr$$

as
$$\int_{0}^{2R_p} V_{\mathrm{overlap}}(x)\, (2R_c+x)^2  dx$$

and approximate as 
$$ \approx (2 R_c)^2 \int_{0}^{2R_p } V_{\mathrm{overlap}}(x)dx$$

and then

$$
B_2\approx  \frac{16\pi}{3} R_c^3  -2 \pi \beta \Pi\left(2 R_c\right)^2 \int_0^{2  R_p} \frac{\pi}{2} R_c\left(2 R_p-x\right)^2 d x
$$

So we finally integrate 

$$
\int_0^{2 R_p}\left(2 R_p-x\right)^2 d x
$$

via a change of variable $y=2 R_p-x$

$$
\int_0^{2 R_p}\left(2 R_p-x\right)^2 d x=\int_{2 R_p}^0 y^2(-d y)=\int_0^{2 R_p} y^2 d y=\frac{\left(2 R_p\right)^3}{3}=\frac{8 R_p^3}{3}
$$

which leads to

$$
B_2 \approx\frac{16\pi}{3} R_c^3 -\frac{32 \pi^2}{3} \beta \Pi R_c^3 R_p^3
$$

where $R_c$ is the colloid radius, $R_p$ is the polymer radius, $\Pi$ is the osmotic pressure of the polymer solution, and $V_{\mathrm{overlap}}(r)$ is the overlap volume between two colloids at separation $r$. This formula shows how $B_2$ depends explicitly on $R_c$, $R_p$, and $\Pi$.

4.  Physical interpretation

-   $B_2$ **decreases** with increasing polymer concentration (via $\Pi$) and polymer size ($R_p$).
-   When the depletion attraction is strong enough, $B_2$ can become **negative**, which signals that attractive interactions dominate over repulsion.
-   Negative $B_2$ implies a tendency for **colloidal aggregation** or even phase separation, because the effective interaction favuors close approach of colloids.

### Colloids and sedimentation

A particle suspended in a liquid can be defined as *colloidal* if the kinetic energy of its thermally-driven Brownian motion is large enough to prevent it from settling completely to the bottom of the container under the influence of gravity. 

A second definition of a colloid is a particle whose gravitational Peclet number Pe is significantly smaller than 1. (The gravitational Peclet number is the ratio of the time taken by a particle to diffuse a distance equal to its radius to the time taken by it to sediment the same distance under gravity.) 

Show that these two definitions of a colloid are essentially equivalent. 	





### Hard Rods and Cavity Function

Consider a 1-dimensional (1D) system of **Hard Rods** of length $\sigma$. The number density is $\rho$, and the equation of state is exactly known as  (Tonks equation): $Z_{\rm comp} = \frac{1}{1 - \rho \sigma}$.

The potential is:
$$
u(x) =
\begin{cases}
\infty, & x < \sigma \\
0, & x \ge \sigma
\end{cases}
$$

The **pair distribution function at contact**, $g(\sigma^+)$, is known to be directly related to the equation of state by the 1D virial theorem (see lecture notes):
$$
Z = 1 + \rho \sigma g(\sigma^+)
$$



1.  Calculate $g(\sigma^+)$ for the 1D hard rod system using the Tonks equation of state and the 1D virial theorem.

2.  Determine the value of the Boltzmann factor, $e^{-\beta u(\sigma)}$, at contact.

3.  Determine the value of the cavity Function, $y(\sigma)= e^{\beta U(r)}g(r)$, at contact.

4.  Explain the physical meaning of $y(\sigma)$. How does it differ from $g(\sigma^+)$ in its interpretation?

5. Derive the full $g(r)$ by maximising the (Shannon) entropy$$
S[p]=-\int_0^{\infty} p(l) \ln p(l) d l
$$ for the probability to find a gap of length $l$. Assume that the gaps are independent for simplicity and see that the $g(r0)$ you obtain matches the previous assumptions.
