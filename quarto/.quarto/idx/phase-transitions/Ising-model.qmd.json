The sophistication of any particular model depends on\nthe properties of the system it is supposed to represent. The simplest\nmodel to exhibit critical phenomena is the two-dimensional Ising model\nof a ferromagnet. Actual physical realizations of 2-d magnetic systems\ndo exist in the form of layered ferromagnets such as K$_2$CoF$_4$, so\nthe 2-d Ising model is of more than just technical relevance.\n\n## The 2D Ising model\n\nThe 2-d spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ Ising model envisages a regular arrangement\nof magnetic moments or 'spins' on an infinite plane. Each spin can take\ntwo values, $+1$ ('up' spins) or $-1$ ('down' spins) and is assumed to\ninteract with its nearest neighbours according to the Hamiltonian\n\n$$\n{\\cal H}_I=-J\\sum_{<ij>}s_is_j - H\\sum_i s_i\n$${#eq-ising}\n\nwhere $J>0$ measures the strength of the coupling\nbetween spins and the sum extends over nearest neighbour spins $s_i$ and\n$s_j$, i.e it is a sum of the bonds of the lattice. $H$ is a magnetic\nfield term which can be positive or negative (although for the time\nbeing we will set it equal to zero). The order parameter is simply the\naverage magnetisation:\n\n$$m=\\frac{1}{N} \\langle \\sum_i s_i \\rangle\\:,$$ where\n$\\langle\\cdot\\rangle$ means an average over configurations.\n\nThe fact that the Ising model displays a phase transition was argued in @sec-background. Thus at low temperatures for which there is\nlittle thermal disorder, there is a preponderance of aligned spins and\nhence a net spontaneous magnetic moment (ie. the system is\nferromagnetic). As the temperature is raised, thermal disorder increases\nuntil at a certain temperature $T_c$, entropy drives the system through\na continuous phase transition to a disordered spin arrangement with zero\nnet magnetisation (ie. the system is paramagnetic). These trends are\nvisible in configurational snapshots from computer simulations of the 2D\nIsing model (see @fig-snapshots). Although each spin interacts only with its\nnearest neighbours, the phase transition occurs due to cooperative\neffects among a large number of spins. In the neighbourhood of the\ntransition temperature these cooperative effects engender fluctuations\nthat can extend over all length-scales from the lattice spacing up to\nthe correlation length.\n\n::: {#fig-snapshots layout-ncol=3}\n![$T=1.2T_c$](Figs/supercrit.png){}\n\n![$T=T_c$](Figs/crit.png){}\n\n![$T=0.95T_c$](Figs/subcrit.png){}\n\nConfigurations of the 2d Ising model. The patterns depict\ntypical arrangements of the spins (white=+1, black=−1) generated in a computer simulation of the\nIsing model on a square lattice of $N=512$ sites, at\ntemperatures (from left to right) of $T= 1.2T_c$, $T=T_c$, and $T=0.95T_c$. \nIn each case only a portion of the system containing $128$ sites in shown. The typical\nisland size is a measure of the correlation length $\\xi$: the excess of black over white\n(below $T_c$ is a measure of the order parameter.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n[An interactive Monte Carlo simulation of the Ising model](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/software/demos/isingmodel.html) demonstrates the phenonomenology,  By altering the temperature you will be able to observe\nfor yourself how the spin arrangements change as one traverses the\ncritical region. Pay particular attention to the configurations near the\ncritical point. They have very interesting properties. We will return to\nthem later!\n\nAlthough the 2-d Ising model may appear at first sight to be an\nexcessively simplistic portrayal of a real magnetic system, critical\npoint universality implies that many physical observables such as\ncritical exponents are not materially influenced by the actual nature of\nthe microscopic interactions. The Ising model therefore provides a\nsimple, yet *quantitatively* accurate representation of the critical\nproperties of a whole range of real magnetic (and indeed fluid) systems.\nThis universal feature of the model is largely responsible for its\nubiquity in the field of critical phenomena. We shall explore these\nideas in more detail later in the course.\n\n## Exact solutions: the one dimensional Ising chain\n\nOne might well ask why the 2D Ising model is the simplest model to\nexhibit a phase transition. What about the one-dimensional Ising model\n(ie. spins on a line)? In fact in one dimension, the Ising model can be\nsolved exactly. It turns out that the system is paramagnetic for all\n$T>0$, so there is no phase transition at any finite temperature. To see\nthis, consider the ground state of the system in zero external field.\nThis will have all spins aligned the same way (say up), and hence be\nferromagnetic. Now consider a configuration with a various \"domain\nwalls\" dividing spin up and spin down regions:\n\n ![(a) Schematic of an Ising chain at $T=0$. (b) At a small finite temperature the chain is split into domains of spins ordered in the same direction. Domains are separated by notional domain “walls”, which cost energy $\\Delta=2J$. Periodic boundary conditions are assumed.](Figs/chain.png){width=80% fig-align=\"center\" #fig-isingchain}\n\n\nInstead of considering the underlying spin configurations, we shall\ndescribe the system in terms of the statistics of its domain walls. The\nenergy cost of a wall is $\\Delta = 2J$, independent of position. Domain\nwalls can occupy the bonds of the lattice, of which there are $N-1$.\nMoreover, the walls are noninteracting, except that you cannot have two\nof them on the same bond. (Check through these ideas if you are unsure.)\n\nIn this representation, the partition function involves a count over all\npossible domain wall arrangements. Since the domain walls are non\ninteracting (eg it doesn't cost energy for one to move along the chain)\nwe can calculate $Z$ by considering the partition function associated\nwith a single domain wall being present or absent on some given bond,\nand then simply raise to the power of the number of bonds:\n\n$$Z=Z_1^{N-1}$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$Z_1=e^{\\beta J} + e^{\\beta (J-\\Delta)}=e^{\\beta J}(1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta})$$\nis the domain wall partition function for a single bond and represent\nthe sum over the two possible states: domain wall absent or present.\nThen the free energy per bond of the system is\n\n$$\\beta f\\equiv \\beta F/(N-1)=-\\ln Z_1=-\\beta J-\\ln(1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta})$$\n\nThe first term on the RHS is simply the energy per spin of the\nferromagnetic (ordered) phase, while the second term arises from the\nfree energy of domain walls. Clearly for any finite temperature (ie. for\n$\\beta<\\infty$), this second term is finite and negative. Hence the free\nenergy will always be lowered by having a finite concentration of domain\nwalls in the system. Since these domain walls disorder the system,\nleading to a zero average magnetisation, the 1D system is paramagnetic\nfor all finite temperatures. *Exercise*: Explain why this argument works\nonly in 1D.\n\n### More general 1D spins systems: transfer matrix method\n\nGenerally speaking one-dimensional systems lend themselves to a degree\nof analytic tractability not found in most higher dimensional models.\nIndeed for the case of a 1-d assembly of $N$ spins each having $m$\ndiscrete energy states, and in the presence of a magnetic field, it is\npossible to reduce the evaluation of the partition function to the\ncalculation of the eigenvalues of a matrix--the so called transfer\nmatrix.\n\nLet us start by assuming that the assembly has cyclic boundary\nconditions, then the total energy of configuration $\\{s\\}$ is\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nH(\\{s\\})=&-\\sum_{i=1}^N (Js_is_{i+1}+Hs_i)\\\\\n\\:=&-\\sum_{i=1}^N (Js_is_{i+1}+H(s_i+s_{i+1})/2)\\\\\n\\:=&\\sum_{i=1}^N E(s_i,s_{i+1})\n\\end{aligned}\n where we have defined $E(s_i,s_{i+1})=-Js_is_{i+1}-H(s_i+s_{i+1})/2$.\n\nNow the partition function may be written\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nZ_N =& \\sum_{\\{s\\}}\\exp\\left(-\\beta H(\\{s\\})\\right)\\nonumber \\\\\n =&\\sum_{\\{s\\}}\\exp\\left(-\\beta[E(s_1,s_2)+E(s_2,s_3)+....E(s_N,s_1)]\\right) \\nonumber\\\\\n =&\\sum_{\\{s\\}}\\exp\\left(-\\beta E(s_1,s_2)\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\beta E(s_2,s_3)\\right)....\\exp\\left(-\\beta E(s_N,s_1)\\right) \\nonumber\\\\\n=&\\sum_{i,j,...,l=1}^m V_{ij}V_{jk}...V_{li} \n\\end{aligned}$${#eq-Vs}\n\nwhere the $V_{ij}=\\exp(-\\beta E_{ij})$ are elements of\nan $m \\times m$ matrix ${\\bf V}$, known as the transfer matrix ($i,j,k$\netc are dummy indices that run over the matrix elements). You should see\nthat the sum over the product of matrix elements picks up all the terms\nin the partition function and therefore @eq-Vs is an alternative way of writing the partition function.\n\nThe reason it is useful to transform to a matrix representation is that\nit transpires that the sum over the product of matrix elements in\n@eq-Vs is simply just the trace of ${\\bf V}^N$ (check this yourself for a short\nperiodic chain), given by the sum of its eigenvalues:-\n\n$$Z_N=\\lambda_1^N+\\lambda_2^N+...\\lambda_m^N$$ For very large $N$, this\nexpression simplifies further because the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$\ndominates the behaviour since $(\\lambda_2/\\lambda_1)^N$ vanishes as\n$N\\rightarrow \\infty$. Consequently in the thermodynamic limit one may\nput $Z_N=\\lambda_1^N$ and the problem reduces to identifying the largest\neigenvalue of the transfer matrix.\n\nSpecializing to the case of the simple Ising model in the presence of an\napplied field $H$, the transfer matrix takes the form\n\n$${\\bf V}(H)=\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\ne^{\\beta(J+H)} & e^{-\\beta J} \\\\\ne^{-\\beta J}   & e^{\\beta(J-H)}\n\\end{array} \\right)$$\n\nThis matrix has two eigenvalues which can be readily calculated in the\nusual fashion as the roots of the characteristic polynomial\n$|{\\bf V}-\\lambda{\\bf I}|$. They are\n\n$$\\lambda_{\\pm}=e^{\\beta J}\\cosh(\\beta H) \\pm \\sqrt{e^{2\\beta J}\\sinh^2\\beta H+e^{-2\\beta J}}.$$\n\nHence the free energy per spin $f=-k_BT\\ln \\lambda_+$ is\n\n$$f=-k_BT\\ln \\left[e^{\\beta J}\\cosh(\\beta H) + \\sqrt{e^{2\\beta J}\\sinh^2\\beta H+e^{-2\\beta J}}\\right].$$\n\nThe Ising model in 2D can also be solved exactly, as was done by Lars\nOnsager in 1940. The solution is extremely complicated and is regarded\nas one of the pinnacles of statistical mechanics. In 3D no exact\nsolution is known.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"live-html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"live-html","base-format":"html","extension-name":"live"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["/Users/phxnw/Dropbox/course-disordered-matter/quarto/_extensions/r-wasm/live/live.lua"],"toc":true,"output-file":"Ising-model.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
