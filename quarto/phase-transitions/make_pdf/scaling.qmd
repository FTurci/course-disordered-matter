# The Static Scaling Hypothesis

Historically, the first step towards properly elucidating near-critical
behaviour was taken with the static scaling hypothesis. This is
essentially a plausible conjecture concerning the origin of power law
behaviour which appears to be consistent with observed phenomena.
According to the hypothesis, the basis for power law behaviour (and
associated scale invariance or "scaling") in near-critical systems is
expressed in the claim that: in the neighbourhood of a critical point,
the basic thermodynamic functions (most notably the free energy) are
*generalized homogeneous functions* of their variables. For such
functions one can always deduce a scaling law such that by an
appropriate change of scale, the dependence on two variables (e.g. the
temperature and applied field) can be reduced to dependence on one new
variable. This claim may be warranted by the following general argument.

A function of two variables $g(u,v)$ is called a generalized homogeneous
function if it has the property

$$g(\lambda^au,\lambda^bv)=\lambda g(u,v)$$ **for all $\lambda$**, where
the parameters $a$ and $b$ (known as scaling parameters) are constants.
An example of such a function is $g(u,v)=u^3+v^2$ with $a=1/3, b=1/2$.

Now, the arbitrary scale factor $\lambda$ can be redefined without loss
of generality as $\lambda^a=u^{-1}$ giving

$$g(u,v)=u^{1/a}g(1,\frac{v}{u^{b/a}})$$ A corresponding relation is
obtained by choosing the rescaling to be $\lambda^b=v^{-1}$.

$$\label{eq:sca2}
g(u,v)=v^{1/b}g(\frac{u}{v^{a/b}},1)$$

This equation demonstrates that $g(u,v)$ indeed satisfies a simple power
law in $\it{one}$ variable, subject to the constraint that $u/v^{a/b}$
is a constant. It should be stressed, however, that such a scaling
relation specifies neither the function $g$ nor the parameters $a$ and
$b$.

Now, the static scaling hypothesis asserts that in the critical region,
the free energy $F$ is a generalized homogeneous function of the
(reduced) thermodynamic fields $t=(T-T_c)/T_c$ and $h=(H-H_c)$.
Remaining with the example ferromagnet, the following scaling assumption
can then be made:

$$F(\lambda^a t,\lambda^b h)=\lambda F(t,h) \:.
\label{eq:scagibbs}$$

Without loss of generality, we can set $\lambda^a=t^{-1}$, implying
$\lambda=t^{-1/a}$ and $\lambda^b=t^{-b/a}$.

Then $$F(t,h)=t^{1/a}F(1,t^{-b/a}h)$$ where our choice of $\lambda$
ensures that $F$ on the rhs is now a function of a single variable
$t^{-b/a}h$.

Now, as stated in @sec-background, the free energy provides the route to all
thermodynamic functions of interest. An expression for the magnetisation
can be obtained simply by taking the field derivative of $F$ (cf. @fig-thermo)

$$m(t,h)=-t^{(1-b)/a}m(1,t^{-b/a}h)
$${#eq-magscale}

In zero applied field $h=0$, this reduces to

$$m(t,0)=(-t)^{(1-b)/a}m(1,0)$$ where the r.h.s. is a power law in $t$.
@eq-mag then allows identification of the exponent $\beta$
in terms of the scaling parameters $a$ and $b$.

$$\beta=\frac{1-b}{a}$$

By taking further appropriate derivatives of the free energy, other
relations between scaling parameters and critical exponents may be
deduced. Such calculations (*Exercise: try to derive them*) yield the results $\delta =
b/(1-b)$,$\gamma = (2b-1)/a$, and $\alpha =(2a-1)/a$ . Relationships
between the critical exponents themselves can be obtained trivially by
eliminating the scaling parameters from these equations. The principal
results (known as "scaling laws") are:-
$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha+\beta(\delta+1)=2 \\
\alpha+2\beta+\gamma=2
\end{aligned} 
$$

Thus, provided all critical exponents can be expressed
in terms of the scaling parameters $a$ and $b$, then only two critical
exponents need be specified, for all others to be deduced. Of course
these scaling laws are also expected to hold for the appropriate
thermodynamic functions of analogous systems such as the liquid-gas
critical point.

## Experimental Verification of Scaling

The validity of the scaling hypothesis finds startling verification in
experiment. To facilitate contact with experimental data for real
systems, consider again @eq-magscale. Eliminating the scaling parameters $a$ and $b$
in favour of the exponents $\beta$ and $\delta$ gives

$$
\frac{m(t,h)}{t^{\beta}}=m(1,\frac{h}{t^{\beta\delta}})
$$ where the RHS of this last equation can be regarded as a function of the single
scaled variable $\tilde{H} \equiv t^{-\beta\delta} h(t,M)$.

For some particular magnetic system, one can perform an experiment in
which one measures $m$ vs $h$ for various fixed temperatures. This
allows one to draw a set of isotherms, i.e. $m-h$ curves of constant
$t$. These can be used to demonstrate scaling by plotting the data
against the scaling variables $M=t^{-\beta}m(t,h)$ and
$\tilde{H}=t^{-\beta\delta}h(t,M)$. Under this scale transformation, it
is found that all isotherms (for $t$ close to zero) coincide to within
experimental error. Reassuringly, similar results are found using the
scaled equation of state of simple fluid systems such as He$^3$ or Xe.

In summary, the static scaling hypothesis is remarkably successful in
providing a foundation for the observation of power laws and scaling
phenomena. However, it furnishes little or no guidance regarding the
role of co-operative phenomena at the critical point. In particular it
provides no means for calculating the values of the critical exponents
appropriate to given model systems.

## Computer simulation {#sec-compsim}

In seeking to employ simulation to obtain estimates of bulk critical
point properties (such as the location of a critical point and the
values of its associated exponents), one is immediately confronted with
a difficulty. The problem is that simulations are necessarily restricted
to dealing with systems of finite-size and cannot therefore accommodate
the truly long ranged fluctuations that characterize the near-critical
regime. As a consequence, the critical singularities in $C_v$, order
parameter, etc. appear rounded and shifted in a simulation study. @fig-shift
shows a schematic example for the susceptibility of a magnet.

![Schematic of the near-critical temperature dependence of the magnet susceptibility in a finite-sized system.](Figs/shift.png){width=60% #fig-shift}
 
Thus the position of the peak in a response function (such as $C_v$)
measured for a finite-sized system does not provide an accurate estimate
of the critical temperature. Although the degree of rounding and
shifting reduces with system size, it is often the case, that
computational constraints prevent access to the largest system sizes
which would provide accurate estimates of critical parameters. To help
deal with this difficulty, finite-size scaling (FSS) methods have been
developed to allow extraction of bulk critical properties from
simulations of finite size. FSS will be discussed
in @sec-fss
