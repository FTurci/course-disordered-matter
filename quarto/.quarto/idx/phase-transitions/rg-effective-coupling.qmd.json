We next adopt some\ncoarse-graining procedure which produces from these original\nconfigurations a set of coarse-grained configurations. We then ask the\nquestion: what is the energy function ${\\cal H}^\\prime$ of the\ncoarse-grained variables which would produce these coarse-grained\nconfigurations with the correct relative probability\n$\\exp(-{\\cal H}^\\prime)$? Clearly the form of ${\\cal H}^\\prime$ depends\non the form of ${\\cal H}$ thus we can write symbolically\n\n$${\\cal H}^\\prime=R({\\cal H})$$\n\nThe operation $R$, which defines the coarse-grained configurational\nenergy in terms of the microscopic configurational energy function is\nknown as a renormalisation group transformation (RGT). What it does is\nto replace a hard problem by a less hard problem. Specifically, suppose\nthat our system is near a critical point and that we wish to calculate\nits large-distance properties. If we address this task by utilizing the\nconfigurational energy and appealing to the basic machinery of\nstatistical mechanics set out in\neqs. [\\[eq:probs\\]](#eq:probs){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:probs\"} and\n [\\[eq:partition\\]](#eq:partition){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:partition\"}, the problem is hard. It is hard because the\nsystem has fluctuations on all the (many) length scales intermediate\nbetween the correlation length $\\xi$ and the minimum length scale\n$L_\\textrm{\nmin}$.\n\nHowever, the task may instead be addressed by tackling the\ncoarse-grained system described by the energy ${\\cal H}^\\prime$. The\nlarge-distance properties of this system are the same as the\nlarge-distance properties of the physical system, since coarse-graining\noperation preserves large-scale configurational structure. In this\nrepresentation the problem is a little easier: while the $\\xi$\nassociated with ${\\cal H}^\\prime$ is the same as the $\\xi$ associated\nwith ${\\cal H}$, the minimum length scale of ${\\cal H}^\\prime$ is bigger\nthan that of ${\\cal H}$. Thus the statistical mechanics of\n${\\cal H}^\\prime$ poses a not-quite-so-many-length-scale problem, a\nproblem which is effectively a little less critical and is thus a little\neasier to solve. The benefits accruing from this procedure may be\namplified by repeating it. Repeated application of $R$ will eventually\nresult in a coarse- grained energy function describing configurations in\nwhich the $\\xi$ is no bigger than the minimum length scale. The\nassociated system is far from criticality and its properties may be\nreliably computed by any of a wide variety of approximation schemes.\nThese properties are the desired large-distance properties of the\nphysical system. As explicit reference to fluctuations of a given scale\nis eliminated by coarse-graining, their effects are carried forward\nimplicitly in the parameters of the coarse-grained energy.\n\nIn order to setup the framework for a simple illustrative example, let\nis return to the lattice Ising model for which the energy function\ndepended only on the product of nearest neighbour spins. The coefficient\nof this product in the energy is the exchange coupling, $J$. In\nprinciple, however, other kinds of interactions are also allowed; for\nexample, we may have a product of second neighbour spins with strength\n$J_2$ or, perhaps, a product of four spins (at sites forming a square\nwhose side is the lattice spacing), with strength $J_3$. Such\ninteractions in a real magnet have their origin in the quantum mechanics\nof the atoms and electrons and clearly depend upon the details of the\nsystem. For generality therefore we will allow a family of exchange\ncouplings $J_1$,$J_2$,$J_3,\\dots$, or $J_a, a =\n1,2,\\dots$ In reduced units, the equivalent coupling strengths are\n$K_a =J_a/k_BT$. Their values determine uniquely the energy for any\ngiven configuration.\n    \n> We note that it is not only useful to allow for arbitrary kinds of interactions: if we wish to repeat the transformation several\n(indeed many) times, it is also necessary because even if we start with only the nearest neighbour coupling in ${\\cal H}$ the transformation will in general produce others in ${\\cal H}^\\prime$.\n\nNow consider the coarse-graining procedure. Let us suppose that this\nprocedure takes the form of a 'majority rule' operation in which the new\nspins are assigned values $+1$ or $-1$ according to the signs of the\nmagnetic moments of the blocks with which they are associated. The new\nenergy function ${\\cal H}^\\prime$ will be expressible in terms of some\nnew coupling strengths $K^\\prime$ describing the interactions amongst\nthe new spin variables (and thus, in effect, the interactions between\nblocks of the original spin variables). The RGT simply states that these\nnew couplings depend on the old couplings: $K_1^\\prime$ is some function\n$f_1$ of all the original couplings, and generally\n\n$$K^\\prime_a=f_a(K_1,K_2,\\dots) =f_a({\\bf K}),~~~~ a= 1, 2,\\dots\n\\label{eq:rgt}$$ where **K** is shorthand for the set $K_1, K_2,\\dots$\n\n## A simple example\n\nThis example illustrates how one can perform the RG transformation\n([\\[eq:rgt\\]](#eq:rgt){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"eq:rgt\"})\ndirectly, without recourse to a 'sequence of typical configurations'.\nThe calculation involves a very crude approximation which has the\nadvantage that it simplifies the subsequent analysis.\n\n![Coarse graining by decimation. The spins on the original lattice are\ndivided into two sets $\\{s^\\prime\\}$ and $\\{\\tilde{s}\\}$. The\n$\\{s^\\prime\\}$ spins occupy a lattice whose spacing is twice that of the\noriginal. The effective coupling interaction between the $\\{s^\\prime\\}$\nspins is obtained by performing the configurational average over the\n$\\{\\tilde{s}\\}$ ](Figs/rglat.png){#fig-rglat width=50%}\n\nConsider an Ising model in two dimensions, with only nearest neighbour\ninteractions as shown in fig. [19](#fig:rglat){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"fig:rglat\"}. We have divided the spins into two sets, the\nspins $\\{s^\\prime\\}$ form a square lattice of spacing $2$, the others\nbeing denoted by $\\{\\tilde{s}\\}$. One then defines an effective energy\nfunction ${\\cal H^\\prime}$ for the $s^\\prime$ spins by performing an\naverage over all the possible arrangements of the $\\tilde{s}$ spins\n\n$$\\exp(-{\\cal H}^\\prime)=\\sum_{\\{\\tilde {s}\\}} \\exp(-{\\cal H}).\n\\label{eq:decimate}$$\n\nThis particular coarse-graining scheme is called 'decimation' because a\ncertain fraction (not necessarily one-tenth!) of spins on the lattice is\neliminated. This formulation of a new energy function realizes two basic\naims of the RG method: the long-distance physics of the 'original'\nsystem, described by ${\\cal H}$, is contained in that of the 'new'\nsystem, described by ${\\cal H}^\\prime$ (indeed the partition functions\nare the same as one can see by summing both sides over $s^\\prime$) and\nthe new system is further from critically because the ratio of $\\xi$ to\nlattice spacing ('minimum length scale') has been reduced by a factor of\n$1/2$ (the ratio of the lattice spacings of the two systems). We must\nnow face the question of how to perform the configuration sum in\neq. [\\[eq:decimate\\]](#eq:decimate){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:decimate\"}. This cannot in general be done exactly, so we\nmust resort to some approximation scheme. The particular approximation\nwhich we invoke is the high temperature series expansion. In its simplest mathematical form, since\n${\\cal H}$ contains a factor $1/k_BT$, it involves the expansion of\n$\\exp(-{\\cal H})$ as a power series:\n\n$$\\exp(-{\\cal H}/k_BT)=1-{\\cal H}/k_BT +\\frac{1}{2!}({\\cal H}/k_BT)^2+.....$$\n\nWe substitute this expansion into the right hand side of\neq. [\\[eq:decimate\\]](#eq:decimate){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:decimate\"} and proceed to look for terms which depend on\nthe $s^\\prime$ spins after the sum over the possible arrangements of the\n$\\tilde{s}$ spins is performed. This sum extends over all the possible\n($\\pm 1$) values of all the $\\tilde{s}$ spins. The first term (the 1) in\nthe expansion of the exponential is clearly independent of the values of\nthe $s^\\prime$ spins. The second term (${\\cal H}$) is a function of the\n$s^\\prime$ spins, but gives zero when the sum over the $s^\\prime$ spins\nis performed because only a single factor of any $s^\\prime$ ever\nappears, and $+ 1 - 1 = 0$. The third term (${\\cal H}^2/2$) does\ncontribute. If one writes out explicitly the form of ${\\cal H}^2/2$ one\nfinds terms of the form\n$K^2s_1^\\prime\\tilde{s}\\tilde{s}s_2^\\prime=K^2s_1^\\prime s_2^\\prime$,\nwhere $s_1^\\prime$ and $s_2^\\prime$ denote two spins at nearest\nneighbour sites on the lattice of $s^\\prime$ spins and $\\tilde{s}$ is\nthe spin (in the other set) which lies between them. Now, in the\ncorresponding expansion of the left hand side of\neq. [\\[eq:decimate\\]](#eq:decimate){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:decimate\"}, we find terms of the form\n$K^\\prime s_1^\\prime s_2^\\prime$, where $K^\\prime$ is the nearest\nneighbour coupling for the $s^\\prime$ spins. We conclude (with a little\nmore thought than we detail here) that\n\n$$K^\\prime=K^2\n\\label{eq:rgdec}$$\n\nOf course many other terms and couplings are generated by the higher\norders of the high temperature expansion and it is necssary to include\nthese if one wishes reliable values for the critical temperature and\nexponents, However, our aim here is to use this simple calculation to\nillustrate the RG method. Let us therefore close our eyes, forget about\nthe higher order terms and show how the RGT\n(eq. [\\[eq:rgdec\\]](#eq:rgdec){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:rgdec\"}) can be used to obtain information on the phase\ntransition.\n\n![Coupling flow under the decimation transformation described in the text.](Figs/flow1.png){#fig-flow1 width=60%}\n\nThe first point to note is that that mathematically\neq. [\\[eq:rgdec\\]](#eq:rgdec){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"eq:rgdec\"}\nhas the fixed point $K^*= 1$; if $K= 1$ then the new effective coupling\n$K^\\prime$ has the same value $1$. Further, if $K$ is just larger than\n$1$, then $K^\\prime$ is larger than $K$, i.e. further away from $1$.\nSimilarly, if $K$ is less than $1$, $K^\\prime$ is less than $K$. We say\nthat the fixed point is unstable: the flow of couplings under repeated\niteration of eq. [\\[eq:rgdec\\]](#eq:rgdec){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:rgdec\"} is away from the fixed point, as illustrated in\nfig. [20](#fig:flow1){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:flow1\"}. The\nphysical significance of this is as follows: suppose that the original\nsystem is at its critical point so that the ratio of $\\xi$ to lattice\nspacing is infinite. After one application of the decimation\ntransformation, the effective lattice spacing has increased by a factor\nof two, but this ratio remains infinite; the new system is therefore\nalso at its critical point. Within the approximations inherent in\neq. [\\[eq:rgdec\\]](#eq:rgdec){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:rgdec\"}, the original system is an Ising model with\nnearest neighbour coupling $K$ and the new system is an Ising model with\nnearest neighbour coupling $K^\\prime$. If these two systems are going to\nbe at a common critically, we must identify $K^\\prime=\nK$. The fixed point $K^*= 1$ is therefore a candidate for the critical\npoint $K_c$, where the phase transition occurs. This interpretation is\nreinforced by considering the case where the original system is close\nto, but not at, criticality. Then $\\xi$ is finite and the new system is\nfurther from critically because the ratio of $\\xi$ to lattice spacing is\nreduced by a factor of two. This instability of a fixed point to\ndeviations of $K$ from $K^*$ is a further necessary condition for its\ninterpretation as a critical point of the system. In summary then we\nmake the prediction\n\n$$K_c=J/k_BT_c=1\n\\label{eq:Kc}$$\n\nWe can obtain further information about the behaviour of the system\nclose to its critical point. In order to do so, we rewrite the\ntransformation (eq. [\\[eq:rgdec\\]](#eq:rgdec){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:rgdec\"}) in terms of the deviation of the coupling from\nits fixed point value. A Taylor expansion of the function $K^\\prime=K^2$\nyields\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nK^\\prime =& (K^*)^2 +(K-K^*)\\left.\\frac{\\partial K^\\prime}{\\partial K}\\right|_{K=K^*}+\\frac{1}{2}(K-K^*)^2\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 K^\\prime}{\\partial K^2}\\right|_{K=K^*}+\\ldots\\nonumber\\\\\nK^\\prime - K^* =& 2 (K - K^*)+ (K - K^*)^2 \n\\end{aligned} where in the second line we have used the fact that the\nfirst derivative evaluates to $2K^*=2$ and $(K^*)^2=K^*$.\n\nFor a system sufficiently close to its critical temperature the final\nterm can be neglected. The deviation of the coupling from its fixed\npoint (critical) value is thus bigger for the new system than it is for\nthe old by a factor of two. This means that the reduced temperature is\nalso bigger by a factor of two:\n\n$$t^\\prime= 2t$$\n\nBut $\\xi$ (in units of the appropriate lattice spacing) is smaller by a\nfactor of $1/2$:\n\n$$\\xi^\\prime= \\xi/2$$\n\nThus, when we double $t$, we halve $\\xi$, implying that\n\n$$\\xi\\propto t^{-1}$$\n\nfor $T$ close to $T_c$. Thus we see that the RGT predicts scaling\nbehaviour with calculable critical exponents. In this simple calculation\nwe estimate the critical exponent $\\nu=1$ for the square lattice Ising\nmodel. This prediction is actually in agreement with the exactly\nestablished value. The agreement is fortuitous- the prediction in\nEq. refeq:Kc for $K_c$, is larger than the exactly established value by\na factor of more than two. In order to obtain reliable estimates more\nsophisticated and systematic methods must be used.\n\nThe crude approximation in the calculation above produced a\ntransformation, eq. [\\[eq:rgdec\\]](#eq:rgdec){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:rgdec\"}, involving only the nearest neighbour coupling,\nwith the subsequent advantages of simple algebra. We pay a penalty for\nthis simplicity in two ways: the results obtained for critical\nproperties are in rather poor agreement with accepted values, and we\ngain no insight into the origin of universality.\n\n## Universality and scaling\n\nIn order to expose how universality can arise, we should from the start\nallow for several different kinds of coupling $J_a$, and show how the\nsystems with *different* $J_a$ can have the *same* critical behaviour.\n\n![General flow in coupling space](Figs/flow2.png){#fig-flow2\nwidth=80%}\n\nFig. [21](#fig-flow2){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:flow2\"} is a\nrepresentation of the space of all coupling strengths $K_a$ in the\nenergy function ${\\cal H}/k_BT$. This is of course actually a space of\ninfinite dimension, but representing three of these, as we have done,\nenables us to illustrate all the important aspects. First let us be\nclear what the points in this space represent. Suppose we have some\nmagnetic material which is described by a given set of exchange\nconstants $J_1,J_2,J_3.....$ As the temperature $T$ varies, the coupling\nstrengths $K_a=J_a/k_BT$ trace out a straight line, or ray, from the\norigin of the space in the direction ($J_1,J_2,J_3 ....$ ). Points on\nthis ray close to the origin represent this magnet at high temperatures,\nand conversely points far from the origin represent the magnet at low\ntemperatures. The critical point of the magnet is represented by a\nspecific point on this ray, $K_a=\nJ_a/k_BT, a= 1,2,\\dots$ The set of critical points on all of the\npossible rays forms a *surface*, the critical surface. Formally, it is\ndefined by the set of all possible models (of the Ising type) which have\ninfinite $\\xi$. It is shown schematically as the shaded surface in\nfig. [21](#fig:flow2){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:flow2\"}. (In\nthe figure it is a two-dimensional surface; more generally it has one\ndimension less than the full coupling constant space, dividing all\nmodels into high and low tempera- ture phases.)\n\nOur immediate goal then is to understand how the RGT can explain why\ndifferent physical systems near this critical surface have the same\nbehaviour. Let us turn now to the schematic representation of the RG\nflow in fig. [21](#fig:flow2){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"fig:flow2\"}. Suppose we start with a physical system, with\ncoupling strengths $K_a,  a= 1,2, \\dots$. What the RGT does is generate\na new point in the figure, at the coupling strengths\n$K_a^{(1)}=f_a({\\bf K})$; these are the couplings appearing in the\neffective energy function describing the coarse-grained system. If we\nrepeat the transformation, the new energy function has coupling\nstrengths $K_a^{(2)}=f_a({\\bf K})$. Thus repeated application of the\ntransformation generates a flow of points in the figure: ${\\bf K\\to\nK^{(1)}\\to\\dots\\to K^{(n)}}$ where the superscript ($n$) labels the\neffective couplings after $n$ coarse-graining steps. if the change in\ncoarse-graining scale is $b$ ($> 1$) at each step, the total change in\ncoarse-graining scale is $b^n$ after $n$ steps. In the process,\ntherefore, the ratio of $\\xi$ to coarse-graining scale is reduced by a\nfactor of $b^{-n}$. The dots in\nfig. [21](#fig:flow2){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:flow2\"}\nidentify three lines of RG flow starting from three systems differing\nonly in their temperature. (The flow lines are schematic but display the\nessential features revealed in detailed calculations.)\n\nConsider first the red dots which start from the nearest neighbour Ising\nmodel at its critical point. The ratio of $\\xi$ to coarse-graining scale\nis reduced by a factor b at each step, but, since it starts infinite, it\nremains infinite after any finite number of steps. In this case we can\nin principle generate an unbounded number of dots,\n${\\bf K^{(1)}, K^{(2)},\\dots,K^{(n)}}$, all of which lie in the critical\nsurface. The simplest behaviour of such a sequence as $n$ increases is\nto tend to a limit, $K^*$, say. In such a case\n\n$$K^*_a=f_a(K^*)~~~~ a= 1,2 .....$$\n\nThis point ${\\bf K^*} \\equiv K_1^*, K_2^*, \\dots$ is therefore a *fixed\npoint* which lies in the critical surface.\n\nBy contrast, consider the same magnet as before, now at temperature $T$\njust greater than $T_c$, its couplings $K_a$, will be close to the first\nred dot (in fact they will be slightly smaller) and so will the\neffective couplings $K_a^{(1)},K_2^{(2)},\\dots$ of the corresponding\ncoarse-grained systems. The new flow will therefore appear initially to\nfollow the red dots towards the same fixed point. However, the flow must\neventually move away from the fixed point because each coarse-graining\nnow produces a model further from criticality. The resulting flow is\nrepresented schematically by one set of black dots. The other set of\nblack dots shows the expected flow starting from the same magnet\nslightly below its critical temperature.\n\nWe are now in a position to understand both universality and scaling\nwithin this framework. We will suppose that there exists a single fixed\npoint in the critical surface which sucks in all flows starting from a\npoint in that surface. Then any system at its critical point will\nexhibit large-length scale physics (large-block spin behaviour)\ndescribed by the single set of fixed point coupling constants. The\nuniqueness of this limiting set of coupling constants is the essence of\ncritical point universality. It is, of course, the algebraic counterpart\nof the unique limiting spectrum of coarse-grained configurations,\ndiscussed in sec [9.5](#sec:unipics){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"sec:unipics\"}. Similarly the scale-invariance of the critical\npoint configuration spectrum (viewed on large enough length scales) is\nexpressed in the invariance of the couplings under iteration of the\ntransformation (after a number of iterations large enough to secure\nconvergence to the fixed point).\n\nTo understand the behaviour of systems near but not precisely at\ncritically we must make a further assumption (again widely justified by\nexplicit studies). The flow line stemming from any such system will, we\nhave argued, be borne towards the fixed point before ultimately\ndeviating from it after a number of iterations large enough to expose\nthe system's noncritical character. We assume that (as indicated\nschematically in the streams of red and blue lines in\nfig. [21](#fig:flow2){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:flow2\"}) the\ndeviations lie along a single line through the fixed point, the\ndirection followed along this line differing according to the sign of\nthe temperature deviation $T-T_c$. Since any two sets of coupling\nconstants on the line (on the same side of the fixed point) are related\nby a suitable coarse-graining operation, this picture implies that the\nlarge-length-scale physics of all near- critical systems differs only in\nthe matter of a length scale. This is the essence of near-critical point\nuniversality.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"live-html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"live-html","base-format":"html","extension-name":"live"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["/Users/ft14968/Repos/course-disordered-matter/quarto/_extensions/r-wasm/live/live.lua"],"toc":true,"output-file":"rg-effective-coupling.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
