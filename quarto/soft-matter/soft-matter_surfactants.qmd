### Structure and examples

In this chapter we discuss the behaviour of a special class of molecules. In these molecules one end contains a 'hydrophilic' (water-loving) part, while the other end is 'hydrophobic' (water-hating). They are called 'amphiphilic' (loving both) molecules, which reflects their structure, or 'surfactants' (from SURFace ACTive AgeNT), which refers to their behaviour in solution.

A few chemical structures are shown below. They illustrates that the hydrophobic tail usually consits of hydrocarbon chains of different lengths and that the hydrophilic head might either be positively or negatively charged, zwitterionic or uncharged.

The hydrocarbon chains are insoluble in water. The molecules are thus preferentially located at the surface, which allows the hydrophilic head to be surrounded by water and the hydrophobic chains to avoid contact with water. There is always an equilibrium between surfactants at the surface and in the bulk of the solution. The coverage of the surface leads to a reduction of the surface tension with increasing surfactant concentration.

### Self-assembled structures

#### Introduction

Above a so-called critical micellar concentration (cmc) surfactants self-assemble in solution spontaneously into larger structures. (In the following we will consider aqueous solutions, although the arguments also apply to other polar or non-polar (organic) solvents.) This allows the hydrophobic parts to crowd together while

being 'shielded' by the hydrophilic heads. The density of the hydrophobic cores is very similar to the density of fluid hydro-carbons and the random arrangements of the chains resemble closely a fluid structure.

The surfactant assemblies are not held together by chemical bonds, but only by weak interactions ( $\lesssim k B T$ ). Their existence and properties are thus determined by a delicate balance between different effects, such as the transfer of hydrophobic chains into the core, interactions between the head group and the entropy of mixing. Small changes in control parameters, for example temperature, salt concentration or pH , thus have large effects on the characteristics of the surfactant aggregates. Nevertheless, for given conditions, they have very well-defined properties (shape, size etc.).

#### Shape of surfactant assemblies

Surfactants spontaneously self-assemble into a variety of different structures. We use geometric or 'packing' considerations to understand and predict the shape of surfactant aggregates. In this model the geometry of a surfactant molecule is described using the following parameters:

- optimal headgroup area $a_{0}$ : As discussed in the previous section, this depends on a delicate balance of forces and is thus not only controlled by the 'chemistry' of the surfactant molecule, but also depends on different control parameters of the solution, such as salt concentration, pH or temperature.
- volume v of the hydrophobic part: The hydrophobic part usually consists of hydrocarbon chains and for saturated hydrocarbons the volume $v$ can be approximated by
$v \approx(27.4+26.9 \mathrm{n}) \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~nm}^{3}$
where n is the number of carbon atoms.
- critical chain length $\boldsymbol{l}_{\boldsymbol{c}}$ : The maximum effective length of the hydrophobic chains is called the critical chain length $l_{c}$, which has to be shorter than the fully extended
molecular length of the chain $l_{\max }$. For saturated hydrocarbons the critical length can be estimated using
$l_{c} \leq l_{\max } \approx(0.154+0.1265 \mathrm{n}) \mathrm{nm}$
The critical chain length heavily depends on the 'chemistry' of the molecule, for example on the presence of double bonds or branching, as well as the temperature.

The structure which will be adopted is determined by a balance between entropy, which favours small aggregates, and energy considerations: A certain shape or size might only be possible by imposing a headgroup area $a>a_{0}$, which is energetically not favourable. We will now establish the criteria for the different shapes.
(A) Spherical micelle:

For a spherical micelle with aggregation number N , the total volume and surface area are given by

$$
\begin{gathered}
N v=\frac{4 \pi}{3} R^{3} \\
N a_{0}=4 \pi R^{2} \\
\therefore \frac{v}{a_{0}}=\frac{R}{3}<\frac{l_{c}}{3}
\end{gathered}
$$

where we used the fact that the radius $R$ cannot be larger than the critical chain length $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{c}}$. We thus obtain for the critical packing parameter $P$

$$
P=\frac{v}{a_{0} l_{c}}<\frac{1}{3}
$$

(B) Cylindrical micelles:

For a cylindrical micelle the total volume and surface area are given by
$N v=\pi R^{2} L$
$N a_{0}=2 \pi R L$
$\therefore \frac{v}{a_{0}}=\frac{R}{2}<\frac{l_{c}}{2}$
again using $R<I_{C}$.

We thus obtain for the critical packing parameter $P$
$\frac{1}{3}<\frac{v}{a_{0} l_{c}}<\frac{1}{2}$

Below the lower limit spherical micelles are formed.

### Bilayers:

For a bilayer the total volume and surface area are given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& N v=A D \\
& N a_{0}=2 A \\
& \frac{v}{a_{0}}=\frac{D}{2}<l_{c} \quad\left(\text { using } D<2 l_{c}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

We thus obtain for the critical packing parameter $P$
$\frac{1}{2}<\frac{v}{a_{0} l_{c}}<1$
Below the lower limit cylindrical micelles are formed.
