Complex disordered matter is a central theme in soft matter physics, encompassing systems such as polymers, colloids, glasses, gels, and emulsions that lack long-range order but display intricate and often tunable behavior. Colloids—suspensions of microscopic particles in a fluid—serve as versatile model systems for studying disordered structures and phase behavior because their particle-scale dynamics are directly observable. Similarly, polymer systems and colloidal suspensions can form amorphous solids, or glasses, when densely packed or cooled, exhibiting solid-like rigidity despite their disordered, liquid-like microscopic structure. These materials frequently undergo equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions such as demixing, crystallisation, gelation, vitrification, or jamming, and near these transitions, they may show critical phenomena where fluctuations and correlations span many length scales.

In soft matter systems, the interplay between disorder, softness, and phase behavior leads to rich physical phenomena, particularly near critical points where even small changes in external conditions can trigger large-scale reorganizations and universal behaviour. Glasses, for instance, exhibit slow relaxation and memory effects, while colloidal systems may crystallize, phase separate, or become jammed depending on particle interactions and concentration. Understanding such behaviors involves studying how microscopic interactions and thermal fluctuations influence macroscopic properties, especially in non-equilibrium conditions. Through techniques like scattering, microscopy, rheology, and simulation, one can explore how disordered soft materials respond to stress, age, or undergo transitions—insights that are vital for applications in materials design, biotechnology, and beyond.

This course is organized into three interconnected parts, each offering a distinct perspective on the study of complex disordered matter.

* **Part 1: Unifying theoretical concepts** (Nigel Wilding) introduces the theoretical framework for rationalising complex disordered matter which is grounded in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. We emphasize the theory of phase transitions, critical phenomena, and stochastic dynamics—providing the essential tools needed to describe and predict the behavior of soft and disordered systems.  
* **Part 2: Complex disordered matter** (Francesco Turci) explores the phenomenology of key examples of complex disordered soft matter systems, including colloids, polymers, liquid crystals, glasses, gels, and active matter. These systems will be analyzed using the theoretical concepts introduced in Part 1, highlighting how disorder, interactions, and fluctuations shape their macroscopic behavior.  
* **Part 3: Experimental techniques** (Adrian Barnes) focuses on the methods of microscopy, and scattering via x-rays, neutrons and light that are used to study these complex disordered matter, offering insight into how their properties are measured and understood in real-world contexts.

In addition to theory and experiment, computer simulation plays a central role in soft matter research. This course includes a substantial coursework component consisting of two computational projects. These exercises will allow you to apply state-of-the-art simulation techniques to investigate the complex behavior of disordered systems, bridging theory and observation through hands-on exploration.

### Delivery and format

* Detailed e-notes (see Blackboard) can be viewed on a variety of devices. Pdf is also available. 

* We will give 'traditional' lectures (XXday, YYYday) in which we use slides to summarise and explain the lecture content. Questions are welcome (within reason...)


* Try to read ahead in the notes, then come to lectures, listen to the explanations and then reread the notes.

* Rewriting the notes or slides to express your own thoughts and understanding, or annotating a pdf copy can help wire the material into your own way of thinking.

* There are problem classes (XXXday) where you can try problem sheets and seek help. I will go over some problems with the class.


* The navigation bar on the left will allow you to access the lecture notes and problem sets.


### Questions and comments
If you have any questions about the course, please don’t hesitate to contact me, either by email (see above) or in a problems class.

Finally, this is a new course for 2025/26, with the lecture notes written from scratch. If you find any errors or mistakes or something which isn’t clear, please let me know, or fill in this anonymous form:
