Introduction to phase behaviour","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\nA wide variety of physical systems undergo rearrangements of their\ninternal constituents in response to the thermodynamic conditions to\nwhich they are subject. Two classic examples of systems displaying such\nphase transitions are the ferromagnet and fluid systems. As the\ntemperature of a ferromagnet is increased, its magnetic moment is\nobserved to decrease smoothly, until at a certain temperature known as\nthe critical temperature, it vanishes altogether.\n\n ![Phase diagram of a simple magnet (schematic)](Figs/isingpd.png){width=80% fig-align=\"center\" #fig-isingpd}\n\nSimilarly, a change of state from liquid to gas can be induced in a\nfluid system (though not in an ideal gas) simply by raising the\ntemperature. Typically the liquid-vapour transition is abrupt,\nreflecting the large density difference between the states either side\nof the transition. However the abruptness of this transition can be\nreduced by applying pressure. At one particular pressure and temperature\nthe discontinuity in the density difference between the two states\nvanishes. These conditions of pressure and temperature serve to locate\nthe critical point for the fluid.\n\n ![Phase diagram of a simple fluid (schematic)](Figs/ljpd1.png){width=80% fig-align=\"center\" #fig-isingpd}\n\n\nIn the vicinity of a critical point, a system displays a host of remarkable behaviors known as *critical phenomena*. Chief among these is the divergence of thermal response functions—such as specific heat, compressibility, or magnetic susceptibility—which signal an enhanced sensitivity to external perturbations. These singularities arise from the emergence of large-scale cooperative interactions among the system’s microscopic constituents, leading to a diverging correlation length. One visually striking manifestation of this is *critical opalescence*, particularly observed in fluids like CO$_2$. As carbon dioxide nears its critical temperature and pressure, the distinction between its liquid and gas phases vanishes, giving rise to huge fluctuations in density. These fluctuations scatter visible light, rendering the fluid milky or opalescent. This scattering effect directly reflects the long-range correlations developing within the fluid. The movie below illustrates the effect as the critical temperature of CO$_2$ is approached from above.\n\n\n{{< video Movies/critical_point_1.mov start=\"4\" title=\"Critical opalesence in Co2\">}}\n\nThe recalcitrant problem posed by the critical region is how best to\nincorporate such collective effects within the framework of a rigorous\nmathematical theory that affords both physical insight and quantitative\nexplanation of the observed phenomena. This matter has been (and still\nis!) the subject of intense theoretical activity.\n\nThe importance of the critical point stems largely from the fact that\nmany of the phenomena observed in its vicinity are believed to be common\nto a whole range of apparently quite disparate physical systems. Systems\nsuch as liquid mixtures, superconductors, liquid crystals, ferromagnets,\nantiferromagnets and molecular crystals may display identical behaviour\nnear criticality. This observation implies a profound underlying\nsimilarity among physical systems at criticality, regardless of many\naspects of their distinctive microscopic nature. These ideas have found\nformal expression in the so-called 'universality hypothesis' which,\nsince its inception some 35 years ago, has enjoyed considerable success.\n\nIn the next few lectures, principal aspects of the contemporary theoretical\nviewpoint of phase transitions and critical phenomena will be reviewed.\nMean field theories of phase transitions will be discussed and their\ninadequacies in the critical region will be exposed. The phenomenology\nof the critical region will we described including power laws, critical\nexponents and their relationship to scaling phenomena. These will be set\nwithin the context of the powerful renormalisation group technique. The\nnotion of universality as a phenomenological hypothesis will be\nintroduced and its implications for real and model systems will be\nexplored. Finally, the utility of finite-size scaling methods for\ncomputer studies of critical phenomena will be discussed, culminating in\nthe introduction of a specific technique suitable for exposing\nuniversality in model systems.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"live-html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"live-html","base-format":"html","extension-name":"live"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["/Users/phxnw/Dropbox/course-disordered-matter/quarto/_extensions/r-wasm/live/live.lua"],"toc":true,"output-file":"introduction.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
