# Background concepts {#sec-background}

In seeking to describe near-critical phenomena, it is useful to have a
quantitative measure of the difference between the phases coalescing at
the critical point: this is the role of the *order parameter*, $Q$. In
the case of the fluid, the order parameter is taken as the difference
between the densities of the liquid and vapour phases. In the
ferromagnet it is taken as the magnetisation. As its name suggest, the
order parameter serves as a measure of the kind of orderliness that sets
in when the temperature is cooled below a critical temperature.

Our first task is to give some feeling for the principles which underlie
the ordering process. The probability $p_a$ that a physical system at
temperature $T$ will have a particular microscopic arrangement
(configuration), labelled $a$, of energy $E_a$ is

$$p_a=\frac{1}{Z}e^{-E_a/k_BT}
$${#eq-probs}

The prefactor $Z^{-1}$ is the *partition function*: since the system
must always have *some* specific arrangement, the sum of the
probabilities $p_a$ must be unity, implying that

$$Z=\sum_ae^{-E_a/k_BT}
$${#eq-partition} where the sum extends over all possible
microscopic arrangements.

These equations assume that physical system evolves rapidly (on the
timescale of typical observations) amongst all its allowed arrangements,
sampling them with the probabilities @eq-probs the expectation value of any physical observable
$O$ will thus be given by averaging $O$ over all the arrangements $a$,
weighting each contribution by the appropriate probability:

$$\bar {O}=\frac{1}{Z}\sum_a O_a e^{-E_a/k_BT}
$${#eq-observable}

Sums like @eq-observable are not easily evaluated. Nevertheless, some
important insights follow painlessly. Consider the case where the
observable of interest is the order parameter, or more specifically the
magnetisation of a ferromagnet.

$$Q=\frac{1}{Z}\sum_a Q_a e^{-E_a/k_BT}
$${#eq-op}

It is clear from @eq-probs that at very low temperature the system will be
overwhelmingly likely to be found in its minimum energy arrangements
(ground states). For the ferromagnet, these are the fully ordered spin
arrangements having magnetisation $+1$, or $-1$.

Now consider the high temperature limit. The enhanced weight that the
fully ordered arrangement carries in the sum of
@eq-op by
virtue of its low energy, is now no longer sufficient to offset the fact
that arrangements in which $Q_a$ has some intermediate value, though
each carry a smaller weight, are vastly greater in number. A little
thought shows that the arrangements which have essentially zero
magnetisation (equal populations of up and down spins) are by far the
most numerous. At high temperature, these disordered arrangements
dominate the sum in @eq-op and the order parameter is zero.

The competition between energy-of-arrangements weighting (or simply
'energy') and the 'number of arrangements' weighting (or 'entropy') is
then the key principle at work here. The distinctive feature of a system
with a critical point is that, in the course of this competition, the
system is forced to choose amongst a number of macroscopically different
sets of microscopic arrangements.

Finally in this section, we note that the probabilistic (statistical
mechanics) approach to thermal systems outlined above is completely
compatible with classical thermodynamics. Specifically, the bridge
between the two disciplines is provided by the following equation

$$F=-k_BT \ln Z
$$ {#eq-free}

where $F$ is the "Helmholtz free energy". All
thermodynamic observables, for example the order parameter $Q$, and
response functions such as the specific heat or magnetic susceptibility
are obtainable as appropriate derivatives of the free energy. For
instance, utilizing
@eq-partition, one can readily verify (try it as an
exercise!) that the average internal energy is given by

$$\bar{E}=-\frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta},$$ 

where $\beta=(k_BT)^{-1}$.

The relationship between other thermodynamic quantities and derivatives
of the free energy are given in
