{"title":"Dynamics of Fluctuations","markdown":{"headingText":"Dynamics of Fluctuations","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nConsider a thermodynamic variable $x$ with zero mean that fluctuates over time. Examples include the local magnetization in a magnetic system or the local density in a fluid. Here, $x$ represents a deviation from the average value — a fluctuation.\n\nWe're interested in how such fluctuations are correlated over time when the system is in thermal equilibrium. For instance, if $x$ is positive at some time $t$, it's more likely to remain positive shortly after.\n\nThese temporal correlations are characterized by the two-time correlation function:\n\n$$\n\\langle x(\\tau) x(\\tau + t) \\rangle\n$$\n\nIn equilibrium, the correlation function must be independent of the starting time $\\tau$. Therefore, we define:\n\n$$\n\\langle x(\\tau) x(\\tau + t) \\rangle = M_{xx}(t)\n$$\n\nThat is, $M_{xx}(t)$ depends only on the time difference $t$.\n\nWe typically expect $M_{xx}(t)$ to decay exponentially over a characteristic correlation time $t_c$:\n\n$$\nM_{xx}(t) \\sim \\exp(-t / t_c)\n$$\n\n\n![Sketch of $M_{xx}(t)$ against $t$](Figs/Mxx(t).png){#fig-Mxx\nwidth=60%} \n\nThis exponential decay reflects how the memory of fluctuations fades with time.\n\nNow consider two different fluctuating variables, $x$ and $y$ (e.g., local magnetizations at different positions). Their cross-correlation function is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\langle x(\\tau) y(\\tau + t) \\rangle = M_{xy}(t)\n$$\n\nThis defines the elements of a dynamic correlation matrix, of which $M_{xx}(t)$ is the diagonal.\n\nIn equilibrium, the principle of **detailed balance** implies microscopic reversibility — there are no net probability currents. As a result, time evolution is symmetric: fluctuations are time-reversal invariant. Therefore:\n\n$$\nM_{xx}(t) = \\langle x(\\tau) x(\\tau + t) \\rangle = \\langle x(\\tau) x(\\tau - t) \\rangle = M_{xx}(-t)\n$$\n\nFor the cross-correlation $M_{xy}$, we have:\n\n$$\nM_{xy}(-t) = \\langle y(\\tau - t) x(\\tau) \\rangle = \\langle y(\\tau) x(\\tau + t) \\rangle\n$$\n\n(using time translation invariance of the equilibrium state). Combining this with the previous symmetry, we find:\n\n$$\nM_{xy}(t) = M_{yx}(t)\n$$\n\nThis means the dynamic correlation matrix is symmetric in its indices — a non-trivial consequence of microscopic time-reversal symmetry.\n\n## Linear Response Theory and the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem\n\nNow suppose we gently perturb the system. For example, we might apply a small thermodynamic force $f_x$ that couples to a fluctuating variable $x$ — like a weak magnetic field $h$ acting on a local magnetization.\n\n(Formally, this means adding a perturbation $-f_x x$ to the Hamiltonian.)\n\nA typical experimental protocol applies the perturbation from $t = -\\infty$ and switches it off at $t = 0$. For $t > 0$, the average response of another variable $y$ is observed to decay:\n\n$$\n\\langle y(t) \\rangle_f = R_{yx}(t) \\, f_x\n$$\n\nHere, $R_{yx}(t)$ is the **response function** describing how $y$ responds to a small force applied to $x$ at earlier times (for $t \\geq 0$).\n\n![Eﬀect of perturbation on a quantity which is zero in equilibrium](Figs/perturbation.png){#fig-perturbation\nwidth=60%} \n\n\nThe key idea is this: If the perturbation is small enough, its effects are indistinguishable from those of a spontaneous fluctuation. So, the decay of the response function should mirror the decay of the correlation function of naturally occurring fluctuations.\n\nThis is the essence of the **fluctuation-dissipation theorem**:\n\n$$\nk_B T \\, R_{yx}(t) = M_{yx}(t)\n$$\n\nThis powerful result says that the system's response to a small disturbance is directly related to the correlation of fluctuations in thermal equilibrium.\n\nThe factor $k_B T$ ensures both sides of the equation have the same physical dimensions.\n\n> *Note:* We skip the full proof, which requires formal machinery from classical mechanics (e.g., Poisson brackets) or quantum mechanics (density matrices). For more, see the final chapter of Chandler.\n\n\n## Onsager's Theorem\n\nNow, recall from the previous section that the correlation matrix is symmetric:\n\n$$\nM_{xy}(t) = M_{yx}(t)\n$$\n\nCombining this with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem gives:\n\n$$\nR_{xy}(t) = R_{yx}(t)\n$$\n\nThis result is known as **Onsager's reciprocal relation**. It states that the response of variable $x$ to a force acting on $y$ is the same as the response of $y$ to a force acting on $x$ — provided the system is in equilibrium.\n\nThis is a deep and subtle consequence of microscopic reversibility, and Onsager's real contribution was realizing such a connection could exist. \n(Onsager also solved the 2D Ising model and won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1968.)\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"live-html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"live-html","base-format":"html","extension-name":"live"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["/Users/ft14968/Repos/course-disordered-matter/quarto/_extensions/r-wasm/live/live.lua"],"toc":true,"output-file":"dynamics-of-fluctuations.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
