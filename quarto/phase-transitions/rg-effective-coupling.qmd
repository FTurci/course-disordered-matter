# The renormalisation group: effective coupling viewpoint

Let us begin by returning to our fundamental @eq-probs,
which we rewrite as

$$p = Z^{-1}e^{-{\cal H}}$$ where ${\cal H}\equiv E/k_BT$.

The first step is then to imagine that we generate, by a computer
simulation procedure for example, a sequence of configurations with
relative probability $\exp(-{\cal H})$. We next adopt some
coarse-graining procedure which produces from these original
configurations a set of coarse-grained configurations. We then ask the
question: what is the energy function ${\cal H}^\prime$ of the
coarse-grained variables which would produce these coarse-grained
configurations with the correct relative probability
$\exp(-{\cal H}^\prime)$? Clearly the form of ${\cal H}^\prime$ depends
on the form of ${\cal H}$ thus we can write symbolically

$${\cal H}^\prime=R({\cal H})$$

The operation $R$, which defines the coarse-grained configurational
energy in terms of the microscopic configurational energy function is
known as a renormalisation group transformation (RGT). What it does is
to replace a hard problem by a less hard problem. Specifically, suppose
that our system is near a critical point and that we wish to calculate
its large-distance properties. If we address this task by utilizing the
configurational energy and appealing to the basic machinery of
statistical mechanics set out in @eq-probs and @eq-partition, the problem is hard. It is hard because the
system has fluctuations on all the (many) length scales intermediate
between the correlation length $\xi$ and the minimum length scale
$L_\textrm{min}$.

However, the task may instead be addressed by tackling the
coarse-grained system described by the energy ${\cal H}^\prime$. The
large-distance properties of this system are the same as the
large-distance properties of the physical system, since coarse-graining
operation preserves large-scale configurational structure. In this
representation the problem is a little easier: while the $\xi$
associated with ${\cal H}^\prime$ is the same as the $\xi$ associated
with ${\cal H}$, the minimum length scale of ${\cal H}^\prime$ is bigger
than that of ${\cal H}$. Thus the statistical mechanics of
${\cal H}^\prime$ poses a not-quite-so-many-length-scale problem, a
problem which is effectively a little less critical and is thus a little
easier to solve. The benefits accruing from this procedure may be
amplified by repeating it. Repeated application of $R$ will eventually
result in a coarse- grained energy function describing configurations in
which the $\xi$ is no bigger than the minimum length scale. The
associated system is far from criticality and its properties may be
reliably computed by any of a wide variety of approximation schemes.
These properties are the desired large-distance properties of the
physical system. As explicit reference to fluctuations of a given scale
is eliminated by coarse-graining, their effects are carried forward
implicitly in the parameters of the coarse-grained energy.

In order to setup the framework for a simple illustrative example, let
is return to the lattice Ising model for which the energy function
depended only on the product of nearest neighbour spins. The coefficient
of this product in the energy is the exchange coupling, $J$. In
principle, however, other kinds of interactions are also allowed; for
example, we may have a product of second neighbour spins with strength
$J_2$ or, perhaps, a product of four spins (at sites forming a square
whose side is the lattice spacing), with strength $J_3$. Such
interactions in a real magnet have their origin in the quantum mechanics
of the atoms and electrons and clearly depend upon the details of the
system. For generality therefore we will allow a family of exchange
couplings $J_1$,$J_2$,$J_3,\dots$, or $J_a, a =
1,2,\dots$ In reduced units, the equivalent coupling strengths are
$K_a =J_a/k_BT$. Their values determine uniquely the energy for any
given configuration.
    
> We note that it is not only useful to allow for arbitrary kinds of interactions: if we wish to repeat the transformation several
(indeed many) times, it is also necessary because even if we start with only the nearest neighbour coupling in ${\cal H}$ the transformation will in general produce others in ${\cal H}^\prime$.

Now consider the coarse-graining procedure. Let us suppose that this
procedure takes the form of a 'majority rule' operation in which the new
spins are assigned values $+1$ or $-1$ according to the signs of the
magnetic moments of the blocks with which they are associated. The new
energy function ${\cal H}^\prime$ will be expressible in terms of some
new coupling strengths $K^\prime$ describing the interactions amongst
the new spin variables (and thus, in effect, the interactions between
blocks of the original spin variables). The RGT simply states that these
new couplings depend on the old couplings: $K_1^\prime$ is some function
$f_1$ of all the original couplings, and generally

$$K^\prime_a=f_a(K_1,K_2,\dots) =f_a({\bf K}),~~~~ a= 1, 2,\dots
$${#eq-rgt} where **K** is shorthand for the set $K_1, K_2,\dots$

## A simple example

This example illustrates how one can perform the RG transformation @eq-rgt
directly, without recourse to a 'sequence of typical configurations'.
The calculation involves a very crude approximation which has the
advantage that it simplifies the subsequent analysis.

![Coarse graining by decimation. The spins on the original lattice are
divided into two sets $\{s^\prime\}$ and $\{\tilde{s}\}$. The
$\{s^\prime\}$ spins occupy a lattice whose spacing is twice that of the
original. The effective coupling interaction between the $\{s^\prime\}$
spins is obtained by performing the configurational average over the
$\{\tilde{s}\}$ ](Figs/rglat.png){#fig-rglat width=40%}

Consider an Ising model in two dimensions, with only nearest neighbour
interactions as shown in @fig-rglat. We have divided the spins into two sets, the
spins $\{s^\prime\}$ form a square lattice of spacing $2$, the others
being denoted by $\{\tilde{s}\}$. One then defines an effective energy
function ${\cal H^\prime}$ for the $s^\prime$ spins by performing an
average over all the possible arrangements of the $\tilde{s}$ spins

$$
\exp(-{\cal H}^\prime)=\sum_{\{\tilde {s}\}} \exp(-{\cal H}).
$${#eq-decimate}

This particular coarse-graining scheme is called 'decimation' because a
certain fraction (not necessarily one-tenth!) of spins on the lattice is
eliminated. This formulation of a new energy function realizes two basic
aims of the RG method: the long-distance physics of the 'original'
system, described by ${\cal H}$, is contained in that of the 'new'
system, described by ${\cal H}^\prime$ (indeed the partition functions
are the same as one can see by summing both sides over $s^\prime$) and
the new system is further from critically because the ratio of $\xi$ to
lattice spacing ('minimum length scale') has been reduced by a factor of
$1/2$ (the ratio of the lattice spacings of the two systems). We must
now face the question of how to perform the configuration sum in @eq-decimate. This cannot in general be done exactly, so we
must resort to some approximation scheme. The particular approximation
which we invoke is the high temperature series expansion. In its simplest mathematical form, since
${\cal H}$ contains a factor $1/k_BT$, it involves the expansion of
$\exp(-{\cal H})$ as a power series:

$$\exp(-{\cal H}/k_BT)=1-{\cal H}/k_BT +\frac{1}{2!}({\cal H}/k_BT)^2+.....$$

We substitute this expansion into the right hand side of @eq-decimate
and proceed to look for terms which depend on
the $s^\prime$ spins after the sum over the possible arrangements of the
$\tilde{s}$ spins is performed. This sum extends over all the possible
($\pm 1$) values of all the $\tilde{s}$ spins. The first term (the 1) in
the expansion of the exponential is clearly independent of the values of
the $s^\prime$ spins. The second term (${\cal H}$) is a function of the
$s^\prime$ spins, but gives zero when the sum over the $s^\prime$ spins
is performed because only a single factor of any $s^\prime$ ever
appears, and $+ 1 - 1 = 0$. The third term (${\cal H}^2/2$) does
contribute. If one writes out explicitly the form of ${\cal H}^2/2$ one
finds terms of the form
$K^2s_1^\prime\tilde{s}\tilde{s}s_2^\prime=K^2s_1^\prime s_2^\prime$,
where $s_1^\prime$ and $s_2^\prime$ denote two spins at nearest
neighbour sites on the lattice of $s^\prime$ spins and $\tilde{s}$ is
the spin (in the other set) which lies between them. Now, in the
corresponding expansion of the left hand side of @eq-decimate, we find terms of the form
$K^\prime s_1^\prime s_2^\prime$, where $K^\prime$ is the nearest
neighbour coupling for the $s^\prime$ spins. We conclude (with a little
more thought than we detail here) that

$$
K^\prime=K^2
$${#eq-rgdec}

Of course many other terms and couplings are generated by the higher
orders of the high temperature expansion and it is necssary to include
these if one wishes reliable values for the critical temperature and
exponents, However, our aim here is to use this simple calculation to
illustrate the RG method. Let us therefore close our eyes, forget about
the higher order terms and show how the RGT @eq-rgdec can be used to obtain information on the phase
transition.

![Coupling flow under the decimation transformation described in the text.](Figs/flow1.png){#fig-flow1 width=60%}

The first point to note is that that mathematically @eq-rgdec
has the fixed point $K^*= 1$; if $K= 1$ then the new effective coupling
$K^\prime$ has the same value $1$. Further, if $K$ is just larger than
$1$, then $K^\prime$ is larger than $K$, i.e. further away from $1$.
Similarly, if $K$ is less than $1$, $K^\prime$ is less than $K$. We say
that the fixed point is unstable: the flow of couplings under repeated
iteration of @eq-rgdec is away from the fixed point, as illustrated in
@fig-flow1. The physical significance of this is as follows: suppose that the original
system is at its critical point so that the ratio of $\xi$ to lattice
spacing is infinite. After one application of the decimation
transformation, the effective lattice spacing has increased by a factor
of two, but this ratio remains infinite; the new system is therefore
also at its critical point. Within the approximations inherent in
@eq-rgdec, the original system is an Ising model with
nearest neighbour coupling $K$ and the new system is an Ising model with
nearest neighbour coupling $K^\prime$. If these two systems are going to
be at a common critically, we must identify $K^\prime=
K$. The fixed point $K^*= 1$ is therefore a candidate for the critical
point $K_c$, where the phase transition occurs. This interpretation is
reinforced by considering the case where the original system is close
to, but not at, criticality. Then $\xi$ is finite and the new system is
further from critically because the ratio of $\xi$ to lattice spacing is
reduced by a factor of two. This instability of a fixed point to
deviations of $K$ from $K^*$ is a further necessary condition for its
interpretation as a critical point of the system. In summary then we
make the prediction

$$
K_c=J/k_BT_c=1
$${#eq-Kc}

We can obtain further information about the behaviour of the system
close to its critical point. In order to do so, we rewrite the 
transformation (@eq-rgdec) in terms of the deviation of the coupling from
its fixed point value. A Taylor expansion of the function $K^\prime=K^2$
yields

\begin{aligned}
K^\prime =& (K^*)^2 +(K-K^*)\left.\frac{\partial K^\prime}{\partial K}\right|_{K=K^*}+\frac{1}{2}(K-K^*)^2\left.\frac{\partial^2 K^\prime}{\partial K^2}\right|_{K=K^*}+\ldots\nonumber\\
K^\prime - K^* =& 2 (K - K^*)+ (K - K^*)^2 
\end{aligned} where in the second line we have used the fact that the
first derivative evaluates to $2K^*=2$ and $(K^*)^2=K^*$.

For a system sufficiently close to its critical temperature the final
term can be neglected. The deviation of the coupling from its fixed
point (critical) value is thus bigger for the new system than it is for
the old by a factor of two. This means that the reduced temperature is
also bigger by a factor of two:

$$t^\prime= 2t$$

But $\xi$ (in units of the appropriate lattice spacing) is smaller by a
factor of $1/2$:

$$\xi^\prime= \xi/2$$

Thus, when we double $t$, we halve $\xi$, implying that

$$\xi\propto t^{-1}$$

for $T$ close to $T_c$. Thus we see that the RGT predicts scaling
behaviour with calculable critical exponents. In this simple calculation
we estimate the critical exponent $\nu=1$ for the square lattice Ising
model. This prediction is actually in agreement with the exactly
established value. The agreement is fortuitous- the prediction in
Eq. refeq:Kc for $K_c$, is larger than the exactly established value by
a factor of more than two. In order to obtain reliable estimates more
sophisticated and systematic methods must be used.

The crude approximation in the calculation above produced a
transformation, @eq-rgdec, involving only the nearest neighbour coupling,
with the subsequent advantages of simple algebra. We pay a penalty for
this simplicity in two ways: the results obtained for critical
properties are in rather poor agreement with accepted values, and we
gain no insight into the origin of universality.

## Universality and scaling

In order to expose how universality can arise, we should from the start
allow for several different kinds of coupling $J_a$, and show how the
systems with *different* $J_a$ can have the *same* critical behaviour.

![General flow in coupling space](Figs/flow2.png){#fig-flow2 width=80%}

@fig-flow2 is a representation of the space of all coupling strengths $K_a$ in the
energy function ${\cal H}/k_BT$. This is of course actually a space of
infinite dimension, but representing three of these, as we have done,
enables us to illustrate all the important aspects. First let us be
clear what the points in this space represent. Suppose we have some
magnetic material which is described by a given set of exchange
constants $J_1,J_2,J_3.....$ As the temperature $T$ varies, the coupling
strengths $K_a=J_a/k_BT$ trace out a straight line, or ray, from the
origin of the space in the direction ($J_1,J_2,J_3 ....$ ). Points on
this ray close to the origin represent this magnet at high temperatures,
and conversely points far from the origin represent the magnet at low
temperatures. The critical point of the magnet is represented by a
specific point on this ray, $K_a=
J_a/k_BT, a= 1,2,\dots$ The set of critical points on all of the
possible rays forms a *surface*, the critical surface. Formally, it is
defined by the set of all possible models (of the Ising type) which have
infinite $\xi$. It is shown schematically as the shaded surface in
@fig-flow2. (In the figure it is a two-dimensional surface; more generally it has one
dimension less than the full coupling constant space, dividing all
models into high and low temperature phases.)

Our immediate goal then is to understand how the RGT can explain why
different physical systems near this critical surface have the same
behaviour. Let us turn now to the schematic representation of the RG
flow in @fig-flow2. Suppose we start with a physical system, with
coupling strengths $K_a,  a= 1,2, \dots$. What the RGT does is generate
a new point in the figure, at the coupling strengths
$K_a^{(1)}=f_a({\bf K})$; these are the couplings appearing in the
effective energy function describing the coarse-grained system. If we
repeat the transformation, the new energy function has coupling
strengths $K_a^{(2)}=f_a({\bf K})$. Thus repeated application of the
transformation generates a flow of points in the figure: ${\bf K\to
K^{(1)}\to\dots\to K^{(n)}}$ where the superscript ($n$) labels the
effective couplings after $n$ coarse-graining steps. if the change in
coarse-graining scale is $b$ ($> 1$) at each step, the total change in
coarse-graining scale is $b^n$ after $n$ steps. In the process,
therefore, the ratio of $\xi$ to coarse-graining scale is reduced by a
factor of $b^{-n}$. The dots in @fig-flow2
identify three lines of RG flow starting from three systems differing
only in their temperature. (The flow lines are schematic but display the
essential features revealed in detailed calculations.)

Consider first the red dots which start from the nearest neighbour Ising
model at its critical point. The ratio of $\xi$ to coarse-graining scale
is reduced by a factor b at each step, but, since it starts infinite, it
remains infinite after any finite number of steps. In this case we can
in principle generate an unbounded number of dots,
${\bf K^{(1)}, K^{(2)},\dots,K^{(n)}}$, all of which lie in the critical
surface. The simplest behaviour of such a sequence as $n$ increases is
to tend to a limit, $K^*$, say. In such a case

$$K^*_a=f_a(K^*)~~~~ a= 1,2 .....$$

This point ${\bf K^*} \equiv K_1^*, K_2^*, \dots$ is therefore a *fixed
point* which lies in the critical surface.

By contrast, consider the same magnet as before, now at temperature $T$
just greater than $T_c$, its couplings $K_a$, will be close to the first
red dot (in fact they will be slightly smaller) and so will the
effective couplings $K_a^{(1)},K_2^{(2)},\dots$ of the corresponding
coarse-grained systems. The new flow will therefore appear initially to
follow the red dots towards the same fixed point. However, the flow must
eventually move away from the fixed point because each coarse-graining
now produces a model further from criticality. The resulting flow is
represented schematically by one set of black dots. The other set of
black dots shows the expected flow starting from the same magnet
slightly below its critical temperature.

We are now in a position to understand both universality and scaling
within this framework. We will suppose that there exists a single fixed
point in the critical surface which sucks in all flows starting from a
point in that surface. Then any system at its critical point will
exhibit large-length scale physics (large-block spin behaviour)
described by the single set of fixed point coupling constants. The
uniqueness of this limiting set of coupling constants is the essence of
critical point universality. It is, of course, the algebraic counterpart
of the unique limiting spectrum of coarse-grained configurations,
discussed in @sec-unipics. Similarly the scale-invariance of the critical
point configuration spectrum (viewed on large enough length scales) is
expressed in the invariance of the couplings under iteration of the
transformation (after a number of iterations large enough to secure
convergence to the fixed point).

To understand the behaviour of systems near but not precisely at
critically we must make a further assumption (again widely justified by
explicit studies). The flow line stemming from any such system will, we
have argued, be borne towards the fixed point before ultimately
deviating from it after a number of iterations large enough to expose
the system's noncritical character. We assume that (as indicated
schematically in the streams of red and blue lines in @fig-flow2
the deviations lie along a single line through the fixed point, the
direction followed along this line differing according to the sign of
the temperature deviation $T-T_c$. Since any two sets of coupling
constants on the line (on the same side of the fixed point) are related
by a suitable coarse-graining operation, this picture implies that the
large-length-scale physics of all near- critical systems differs only in
the matter of a length scale. This is the essence of near-critical point
universality.
