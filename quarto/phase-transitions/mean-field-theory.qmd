# Mean field theory and perturbation schemes {#sec-meanfield}

Of the wide variety of models of interest to the critical point
theorist, the majority have shown themselves intractable to direct
analytic (pen and paper) assault. In a very limited number of instances
models have been solved exactly, yielding the phase coexistence
parameters, critical exponents and the critical temperature. The 2-d
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Ising model is certainly the most celebrated such
example, its principal critical exponents are found to be
$\beta=\frac{1}{8}, \nu=1, \gamma=\frac{7}{4}$. Its critical temperature
is $-2J/\ln(\sqrt{2}-1)\approx 2.269J$. Unfortunately such solutions
rarely afford deep insight to the general framework of criticality
although they do act as an invaluable test-bed for new and existing
theories.

The inability to solve many models exactly often means that one must
resort to approximations. One such approximation scheme is mean field
theory.

## Mean field solution of the Ising model {#sec-mfising}

Let us look for a mean field expression for the free energy of the Ising
model whose Hamiltonian is given in @eq-ising .
Write

$$s_i=\langle s_i\rangle+(s_i-\langle s_i\rangle)=m+(s_i-m)=m+\delta s_i$$

Then $$\begin{aligned}
{\cal H}_I=&-J\sum_{<i,j>}[m+(s_i-m)][m+(s_j-m)]-H\sum_i s_i\nonumber\\
=&-J\sum_{<i,j>}[m^2+m(s_i-m)+m(s_j-m)+\delta s_i\delta s_j]-H\sum_i s_i\nonumber\\
=&-J\sum_{i}(qms_i-qm^2/2)-H\sum_i s_i-J\sum_{<i,j>}\delta s_i\delta s_j 
\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-mfa}
where in the last line we have used the fact that when
for each site $i$ we perform the sum $\sum_{<i,j>}$ over bonds of a
quantity which is independent of $s_j$, then the result is just the
number of bonds per site times that quantity. Since the number of bonds
on a lattice of $N$ sites of coordination $q$ is $Nq/2$ (because each
bond is shared between two sites), there are therefore $q/2$ bonds per
site.

Now the mean field approximation is to ignore the last term in the last line of @eq-mfa giving the configurational energy as

$$
{\cal H}_{mf}=-\sum_{i}H_{mf}s_i+NqJm^2/2
$$ 
with $H_{mf}\equiv qJm+ H$ the "mean field" seen by spin $s_i$. As all the spins are decoupled
(independent) in this approximation we can write down the partition
function, which follows by taking the partition function for a single
spin (by summing the Boltzmann factor for $s_i=\pm 1$) and raising to
the power $N$ to find

$$
Z=e^{-\beta qJm^2N/2}[2\cosh(\beta(qJm+H))]^N
$$

The free energy follows as

$$F(m)=NJqm^2/2-Nk_BT\ln[2\cosh(\beta (qJm+H)]\:.$$

and the magnetisation as

$$
m=-\frac{1}{N}\frac{\partial F}{\partial H}=\tanh(\beta(qJm+H))
$$

This is a self consistent equation because $m$ appears on both the left and the right hand sides. 
To find $m(H,T)$, we must numerically solve this last equation-self
consistently. You will meet such an equation again later when you learn about mean field theories for liquid crystals. 

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Why self-consistent?

In mean-field theory, the many-body interaction is replaced by an effective one-body problem in which each degree of freedom experiences an average field generated by all the others.
The quantity that characterises the ordered phase—the order parameter—is precisely this average.
Because the effective (mean-field) Hamiltonian is constructed using a *presumed* value of that average, internal consistency requires that the order parameter 
obtained by solving the effective problem *match* the value assumed to define it. Enforcing this equality yields a self-consistency 
condition for the order parameter. In practice: choose the effective field determined by the putative order parameter, 
compute the corresponding thermal average, and require that the two coincide.

:::


Note that we can obtain $m$ in a different way. Consider some arbitary
spin, $s_i$ say. Then this spin has an energy ${\cal H}_{mf}(s_i)$.
Considering this energy for both cases $s_i=\pm 1$ and the probability
$p(s_i)=e^{-\beta{\cal H}_{mf}(s_i)}/Z$ of each, we have that

$$\langle s_i\rangle=\sum_{s_i=\pm 1}s_ip(s_i)$$ but for consistancy,
$\langle s_i\rangle=m$. Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
m & = \sum_{s_i=\pm 1}s_ip(s_i)\nonumber\\
 \: & = \frac{e^{\beta(qJm+H)}-e^{\beta(qJm+H)}} {e^{\beta(qJm+H)}+e^{-\beta(qJm+H)}}\nonumber\\
 \: & = \tanh(\beta(qJm+H))
\end{aligned}$${#eq-mfmag} as before.

## Spontaneous symmetry breaking {#sec-breaking}

 ![Schematic of the form of the free energy for a critical, subcritical and supercritical temperature](Figs/freeenergy_color.png){width=70%  #fig-freeenergy}


This mean field analysis reveals what is happening in the Ising model
near the critical temperature $T_c$.
@fig-freeenergy shows sketches for $\beta F(m)/N$ as a
function of temperature, where for f simplicity we restrict attention to
$H=0$. In this case $F(m)$ is symmetric in $m$, Moreover, at high $T$,
the entropy dominates and there is a single minimum in $F(m)$ at $m=0$.
As $T$ is lowered, there comes a point ($T=T_c=qJ/k_B$) where the
curvature of $F(m)$ at the origin changes sign; precisely at this point

$$\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial m^2}=0.$$ At lower temperature, there are
instead two minima at nonzero $m=\pm m^\star$, where the *equilibrium
magnetisation* $m^\star$ is the positive root (calculated explicitly
below) of

$$m^\star=\tanh(\beta Jqm^\star)= \tanh(\frac{m^\star T_c}{T})$$ The
point $m=0$ which remains a root of this equation, is clearly an
unstable point for $T<T_c$ (since $F$ has a maximum there).

This is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the absence of
an external field, the Hamiltonian (and therefore the free energy) is
symmetric under $m\to -m$. Accordingly, one might expect the actual
state of the system to also show this symmetry. This is true at high
temperature, but spontaneously breaks down at low ones. Instead there
are a pair of ferromagnetic states (spins mostly up, or spins mostly
down) which -- by symmetry-- have the same free energy, lower than the
unmagnetized state.

## Phase diagram

The resulting zero-field magnetisation curve $m(T,H=0)$ looks like
@fig-isingmag.

 ![Phase diagram of a simple magnet in the $m$-$T$ plane.](Figs/isingmag_new.png){width=70% fig-align="center" #fig-isingmag}


This shows the sudden change of behaviour at $T_c$ (phase transition).
For $T<T_c$ it is arbitrary which of the two roots $\pm m^\star$ is
chosen; typically it will be different in different parts of the sample
(giving macroscopic "magnetic domains"). But this behaviour with
temperature is *qualitatively modified* by the presence of a field $H$,
however small. In that case, there is always a slight magnetization,
even far above $T_c$ and the curves becomes smoothed out, as shown.
There is no doubt which root will be chosen, and no sudden change of the
behaviour (no phase transition). Spontaneous symmetry breaking does not
occur, because the symmetry is already broken by $H$. (The curve $F(m)$
is lopsided, rather than symmetrical about $m=0$.)

On the other hand, if we sit below $T_c$ in a positive field (say) and
gradually reduce $H$ through zero so that it becomes negative, there is
a *very* sudden change of behaviour at $h=0$: the equilibrium state
jumps discontinuously from $m=m^\star$ to $m=-m^\star$.


 ![Phase diagram of a simple magnet in the $H$-$T$ plane.](Figs/isingpdH.png){width=70% #fig-isingpdH}

This is called a first order phase transition as opposed to the "second
order" or continuous transition that occurs at $T_c$ in zero field. The
definitions are:

*First order transition:* magnetisation (or similar order parameter)
depends discontinuously on a field variable (such as $h$ or $T$).

*Continuous transition:* Change of functional form, but no discontinuity
in $m$; typically, however, $(\partial m/\partial T)_h$ (or similar) is
either discontinuous, or diverges with an integrable singularity.

In this terminology, we can say that the phase diagram of the magnet in
the $H,T$ plane shows a line of first order phase transitions,
terminating at a continuous transition, which is the critical point.

## Aside on Quantum Criticality

In some magnetic systems such as $CePd_2Si_2$, one can, by applying
pressure or altering the chemical composition, depress the critical
temperature all the way to abolute zero! This may seem counterintuitive,
after all at $T=0$ one should expect perfect ordering, not the large
fluctuations that accompany criticality. It turns out that the source of
the fluctuations that drive the system critical is zero point motion
associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Quantum
criticality is a matter of ongoing active research, and open questions
concern the nature of the phase diagrams and the relationship to
superconductivity. Although the subject goes beyond the scope of this
course, there is an accessible article [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4628) if
you want to learn more.

## A closer look: critical exponents

Let us now see how we can calculate critical exponents within the mean
field approximation.

### Zero H solution and the order parameter exponent

In zero field

$$m=\tanh(\frac{mT_c}{T})$$ where $T_c=qJ/k_B$ is the critical
temperature at which $m$ first goes to zero.

We look for a solution where $m$ is small ($\ll 1$). Expanding the tanh
function and replacing $\beta=(k_BT)^{-1}$ yields

$$m=\frac{mT_c}{T}-\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{mT_c}{T} \right)^3 +O(m^5)\:.$$
Then $m=0$ is one solution. The other solution is given by

$$m^2=3\left(\frac{T}{T_c} \right)^3\left(\frac{T_c}{T} -1\right)$$

Now, considering temperatures close to $T_c$ to guarantee small $m$, and
employing the reduced temperature $t=(T-T_c)/T_c$, one finds

$$m^2\simeq -3t$$

Hence

$$\begin{aligned}
m= 0  &    ~~~\textrm{for } T>T_c \:\:\:  \textrm{ since~otherwise~{\it m}~imaginary}\nonumber\\
m= \pm\sqrt{-3t} & ~~\textrm{ for}  \:\:\: T<T_c ~~\textrm{ real}
\end{aligned} $${#eq-mbeta}
This result implies that (within the mean field
approximation) the critical exponent $\beta=1/2$.

### Finite (but small) field solution: the susceptibility exponent {#sec:closerlook}

In a finite, but small field we can expand @eq-mfmag thus:

$$m=\frac{mT_c}{T}-\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{mT_c}{T} \right)^3 +\frac{H}{kT}$$

Consider now the isothermal susceptibility

$$
\begin{aligned}
\chi  \equiv & \left(\frac{\partial m}{\partial H}\right)_T\\
      =     & \frac{T_c}{T}\chi - \left(\frac{T_c}{T}\right)^3 \chi m^2 + \frac{1}{k_BT}  
\end{aligned}
$$

Then

$$\chi \left[ 1-\frac{T_c}{T} +\left(\frac{T_c}{T}\right)^3m^2  \right]=\frac{1}{k_BT}$$

Hence near $T_c$

$$\chi=\frac{1}{k_BT_c}\left(\frac{1}{t+m^2}\right)$$

Then using the results of @eq-mbeta

$$
\begin{aligned}
\chi= (k_BT_ct)^{-1} & \textrm{ for} ~~~ T> T_c \\
\chi= (-2k_BT_ct)^{-1} & \textrm{ for}  ~~~T \le T_c 
\end{aligned} 
$$

where one has to take the non-zero value for $m$ below
$T_c$ to ensure +ve $\chi$, i.e. thermodynamic stability. This result
implies that (within the mean field approximation) the critical exponent
$\gamma=1$.

The schematic behaviour of the Ising order parameter and susceptibility
are shown in @fig-mfsum (a) and (b) respectively.

## Landau theory {#sec-landau-theory}

Landau theory is a slightly more general type of mean field theory than
that discussed in the previous subsection because it is not based on a
particular microscopic model. Its starting point is the Helmholtz free
energy, which Landau asserted can be written in terms of
power series expansion of the order parameter $\phi$:

$$
F_(\phi)=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}a_i\phi^i
$$
The equilibrium value of $\rho$ is that which minimises the Landau free energy.

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## A note on order parameters

We have already seen examples of these in earlier sections, e.g., for the liquid-gas transition this was
$$
\rho_{liq} - \rho_{gas}: \quad \textrm{difference in density of two coexisting phases},
$$
while for the Ising magnet it is the magnetisation $m$. Both quantities vanish at the critical point.
These are examples of *scalar* order parameters – a single number is required to represent the degree of order ($n = 1$).

In the absence of a symmetry-breaking field, the Landau free-energy density $f_L$ must have symmetry $f_L(-\phi) = f_L(\phi)$ (Ising case).

For some other systems, $n$ component vectors are required in order to represent the order:

$$
\boldsymbol{\phi} = (\phi_1, \phi_2, \dots, \phi_n)
$$

Then $f_L(\boldsymbol{\phi})$ should be symmetric under $O(n)$ rotations in $n$-component $\phi$-space.

The table below lists examples of order parameters for various physical systems.

**Notes:**

* In **superfluid** $^4He$ the order parameter is 

$$
\Psi = |\Psi| e^{i\theta},
$$

the *complex wavefunction* of the macroscopic condensate. Both the amplitude $|\Psi|$ and phase $\theta$ must be specified, so this corresponds to $n = 2$.  
**Superconductors** also correspond to $n = 2$.

* In a **nematic** liquid crystal, the *orientational* order parameter is

$$
\langle P_2(\cos \theta) \rangle \equiv \frac{1}{2}\langle 3\cos^2 \theta - 1\rangle,
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle a molecule makes with the average direction of the long axes of the molecules (known as the *director* $\hat{n}$).
Rotational symmetry is broken. For the case of an $n$ component vector, the free energy should be a function of:

$$
\phi^2 \equiv |\boldsymbol{\phi}|^2 = \phi_1^2 + \phi_2^2 + \dots + \phi_n^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \phi_i^2
$$
in the absence of a symmetry breaking field. Rotational symmetry is incorporated into the theory.

To exemplify the approach, let us specialise to the case of a ferromagnet where $\phi=m$, the magnetisation and write the Landau free energy
as

$$
F(m)=F_0+a_2m^2+a_4m^4
$${#eq-landau}

Here only the terms compatible with the order parameter symmetry are
included in the expansion and we truncate the series at the 4th power because this is all that is necessary to yield the essential phenomenology.
On symmetry grounds, the free energy of a ferromagnet should be invariant under a reversal of the sign of the
magnetisation. Terms linear and cubic in $m$ are not invariant under
$m\to -m$, and so do not feature.

One can understand how the Landau free energy can give rise to a
critical point and coexistence values of the magnetisation, by plotting $F(m)$ for various values of $a_2$ with
$a_4$ assumed positive (which ensures that the magnetisation remains
bounded). This is shown in the following movie:


<!--
This is shown in @fig-landau.
This is shown in the movie below. For $a_2>0$ there is a single mimimum in $F(m)$ at $m=0$ and the system is in the disordered (paramagnetic) phase.
For $a_2=0$, one has $\frac{d^2F}{dm^2}=0$ corresponding to a critical point. As $a_2$ turns negative, a double well structure emerges, with the positions
of the minima marking the coexistence magnetisation values, and thus tracing out the coexistence curve.


 ![Form of the Landau Free energy for a selection of values of the $a_2$ parameter.](Figs/landau_free_energy.png){width=70% fig-align="center" #fig-landau}
-->


{{< video Movies/landau_free_energy_evolution.mp4 title="Varying a2 from positive to negative">}}


The situation is qualitatively similar to that discussed in @sec-breaking.
Thermodynamics tells us that the system adopts the state of lowest free
energy. From the movie, we see that for $a_2>0$, the system will have
$m=0$, i.e. will be in the disordered (or paramagnetic) phase. For
$a_2<0$, the minimum in the free energy occurs at a finite value of $m$,
indicating that the ordered (ferromagnetic) phase is the stable one. In
fact, the physical (up-down) spin symmetry built into $F$ indicates that
there are two equivalent stable states at $m=\pm m^\star$. $a_2=0$
corresponds to the critical point which marks the border between the
ordered and disordered phases. Note that it is an inflexion point, so has $\frac{d^2F}{dm^2}=0$.

Clearly $a_2$ controls the deviation from the critical temperature, and
accordingly we may write

$$a_2=\tilde{a_2} t$$ where $t$ is the reduced temperature. Thus we see that the trajectory of the minima as a function of $a_2<0$
in the above movie effective traces out the coexistence curve in the $m-T$ plane.

We can now attempt to calculate critical exponents. Restricting
ourselves first to the magnetisation exponent $\beta$ defined by
$m=t^\beta$, we first find the equilibrium magnetisation, corresponding
to the minimum of the Landau free energy:

$$
\frac{dF}{dm}=2\tilde{a_2} tm+4a_4m^3=0
$${#eq-minimize}

which implies

$$m\propto (-t)^{1/2},$$ so $\beta=1/2$, which is again a mean field
result.

Likewise we can calculate the effect of a small field $H$ if we sit at
the critical temperature $T_c$. Since $a_2=0$, we have

$$F(m)=F_0+a_4m^4-Hm$$

$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial m}=0 \Rightarrow m(H,T_c)=\left(\frac{H}{4a_4}\right)^{1/3}$$

or

$$H \sim m^\delta ~~~~~ \delta=3$$ which defines a second
critical exponent.

Note that at the critical point, a small applied field causes a very big
increase in magnetisation; formally, $(\partial m/\partial H)_T$ is
infinite at $T=T_c$.

A third critical exponent can be defined from the magnetic
susceptibility at zero field

$$\chi=\left(\frac{\partial m}{\partial H}\right)_{T,V} \sim |T-T_c|^{-\gamma}$$

*Exercise*: Show that the Landau expansion predicts $\gamma=1$.

Finally we define a fourth critical exponent via the variation of the
heat capacity (per site or per unit volume) $C_H$, in fixed external
field $H=0$:

$$C_H \sim |T-T_c|^{-\alpha}$$

By convention, $\alpha$ is defined to be positive for systems where
there is a *divergence* of the heat capacity at the critical point (very
often the case). The heat capacity can be calculated from

$$C_H =-T\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial T^2}$$

From the minimization over $m$ @#eq-minimize one finds (*exercise*: check this)
$$
\begin{aligned}
F = & 0 ~~~~T>T_c\nonumber\\
F = & -a_2^2/4a_4 ~~~~ T < T_c
\end{aligned} 
$$

Using the fact that $a_2$ varies linearly with $T$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
C_H =& 0 ~~~~ T\to T_c^+\nonumber\\
C_H =& \frac{T\tilde a_2^2}{2a_4} ~~~~ T \to T_c^-\:,
\end{aligned} 
$$

which is actually a step discontinuity in specific heat.
Since for positive $\alpha$ the heat capacity is divergent, and for
negative $\alpha$ it is continuous, this behaviour formally corresponds
to $\alpha=0$

## Shortcomings of mean field theory

While mean field theories provide a useful route to understanding
qualitatively the phenomenology of phase transitions, in real
ferromagnets, as well as in more sophisticated theories, the critical
exponents are not the simple fraction and integers found here. This
failure of mean field theory to predict the correct exponents is of
course traceable to their neglect of correlations. In later sections we
shall start to take the first steps to including the effects of long
range correlations.
