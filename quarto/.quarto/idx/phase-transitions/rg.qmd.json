Such a profusion of degrees of freedom can only be accurately\ncharacterized by a very large number of variables. Mean field theories\nand approximation schemes fail in the critical region because they at\nbest incorporate interactions among only a few spins, while neglecting\ncorrelations over larger distances. Similarly, the scaling hypothesis\nfails to provide more than a qualitative insight into the nature of\ncriticality because it focuses on only one length-scale, namely the\ncorrelation length itself. Evidently a fuller understanding of the\ncritical region may only be attained by taking account of the existence\nof structure on all length-scales. Such a scheme is provided by the\nrenormalisation group method, which stands today as the cornerstone of\nthe modern theory of critical phenomena.\n\n## The critical point: A many length scale problem\n\nA near critical system can be characterized by three important length\nscales, namely\n\n1.  The correlation length, $\\xi$, ie the size of correlated\n    microstructure.\n\n2.  Minimum length scale $L_\\textrm{ min}$, i.e. the smallest length in the\n    microscopics of the problem, e.g. lattice spacing of a magnet or the\n    particle size in a fluid.\n\n3.  Macroscopic size $L_{max}$ eg. size of the system.\n\nThe authentic critical region is defined by a window condition:\n\n$$L_\\textrm{ max} \\gg \\xi \\gg L_\\textrm{ min}$$\n\nThe physics of this regime is hard to tackle by analytic theory because\nit is characterized by configurational structure on all scales between\n$L_\\textrm{ min}$ and $\\xi$ (in fact it turns out that the near critical\nconfigurational patterns are *fractal*-like, cf.\nfig. [5](#fig:snapshots){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"fig:snapshots\"}(b)). Moreover different length scales are\ncorrelated with one another, giving rise to a profusion of coupled\nvariables in any theoretical description. The window regime is also not\neasily accessed by computer simulation because it entails studying very\nlarge system sizes $L_\\textrm{\nmax}$, often requiring considerable computing resources.\n\n## Methodology of the RG {#sec-rgmethod}\n\nThe central idea of the renormalisation group (RG) method is a stepwise\nelimination of the degrees of freedom of the system on successively\nlarger length-scales. To achieve this one introduces a fourth length\nscale $L$. In contrast to the other three, which characterize the system\nitself, $L$ characterises the *description* of the system. It may be\nthought of as typifying the size of the smallest resolvable detail in a\ndescription of the system's microstructure.\n\nConsider the Ising model arrangements displayed in\n@fig-snapshots (a)-(c). These pictures contain *all* the\ndetails of each configuration shown: the resolution length $L$ in this\ncase has its smallest possible value, coinciding with the lattice\nspacing i.e. $L=L_{\\min}$. In the present context, the most detailed\ndescription is not the most useful: the essential signals with which we\nare concerned are hidden in a noise of relevant detail. A clue to\neliminating this noise lies in the nature of the correlation length,\ni.e. the size of the largest droplets. The explicit form of the small\nscale microstructure is irrelevant to the behaviour of $\\xi$. The small\nscale microstructure is the noise. To eliminate it, we simply select a\nlarger value of the resolution length (or 'coarse-graining' length) $L$.\n\nThere are many ways of implementing this coarse-graining procedure. We\nadopt a simple strategy in which we divide our sample into blocks of\nside $L$, each of which contains $L^d$ sites, with $d$ the space\ndimensions . The centres of the blocks define a lattice of points\nindexed by $I=1,2,N/L^d$. We associate with each block lattice\npoint centre, $I$, a coarse-grained or block variable $S_I(L)$ defined\nas the spatial average of the local variables it contains:\n\n$$\nS_I(L)=L^{-d}\\sum_i^Is_i\n$${#eq-blkvar} \nwhere the sum extends over the $L^d$ sites in the\nblock $I$. The set of coarse grained coordinates $\\{S(L)\\}$ are the\nbasic ingredients of a picture of the system having spatial resolution\nof order $L$.\n\nThe coarse graining operation is easily implemented on a computer. In so\ndoing one is faced with the fact that while the underlying Ising spins\ncan only take two possible values, the block variables $S_I(L)$ have\n$L^d+1$ possible values. Accordingly in displaying the consequences of\nthe blocking procedure, we need a more elaborate colour convention than\nthat used in @fig-snapshots. We will associate with each block a shade of\ngrey drawn from a spectrum ranging from black to white.\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2 #fig-c1}\n![(ai)](Figs/a1_2state.png){width=50%}\n\n![(bi)](Figs/b1_2state.png){width=50%}\n\n![(aii)](Figs/a2_2state.png){width=50%}\n\n![(bii)](Figs/b2_2state.png){width=50%}\n\n![(aiii)](Figs/a3_2state.png){width=50%}\n\n![(biii)](Figs/b3_2state.png){width=50%}\n\n![(aiv)](Figs/schem_op_disordered.png){width=60%}\n\n![(biv)](Figs/schem_op_ordered.png){width=84%}\n\nSee text for details\n:::\n\n  \nThe results of coarse-graining configurations typical of three different \ntemperatures are shown in @fig-c1 and @fig-c2. Two auxiliary operations are implicit in these\nresults. The first operation is a *length scaling*: the lattice spacing\non each blocked lattice has been scaled to the same size as that of the\noriginal lattice, making possible the display of correspondingly larger\nportions of the physical system. The second operation is a *variable\nscaling*: loosely speaking, we have adjusted the scale ('contrast') of\nthe block variable so as to match the spectrum of block variable values\nto the spectrum of shades at our disposal.\n\nConsider first a system marginally above its critical point at a\ntemperature $T$ chosen so that the correlation length $\\xi$ is\napproximately 6 lattice spacing units. A typical arrangement (without\ncoarse-graining) is shown in @fig-c1(ai). The succeeding figures, @fig-c1(aii) and @fig-c1(aiii), show the\nresult of coarse-graining with block sizes $L=4$ and $L=8$,\nrespectively. A clear trend is apparent. The coarse-graining *amplifies*\nthe consequences of the small deviation of $T$ from $T_c$. As $L$ is\nincreased, the ratio of the size of the largest configurational features\n($\\xi$) to the size of the smallest ($L$) is reduced. The ratio $\\xi/L$\nprovides a natural measure of how 'critical' is a configuration. Thus\nthe coarse-graining operation generates a representation of the system\nthat is effectively less critical the larger the coarse-graining length.\nThe limit point of this trend is the effectively fully disordered\narrangement shown in @fig-c1(aiii)  and in an alternative form in @fig-c1(aiv), which\nshows the limiting distribution of the coarse grained variables,\naveraged over many realizations of the underlying configurations: the\ndistribution is a Gaussian which is narrow (even more so the larger the\n$L$ value) and centred on zero. This limit is easily understood. When\nthe system is viewed on a scaled $L$ larger than $\\xi$, the correlated\nmicrostructure is no longer explicitly apparent; each coarse-grained\nvariable is essentially independent of the others.\n\nA similar trend is apparent below the critical point.\n@fig-c1(bi) show a\ntypical arrangement at a temperature $T<T_c$ such that again $\\xi$ is\napproximately $6$ lattice spacings. Coarse-graining with $L=4$ and $L=8$\nagain generates representations which are effectively less critical\n(@fig-c1(bii) and (biii)). This time the coarse-graining smoothes out the microstructure\nwhich makes the order incomplete. The limit point of this procedure is a\nhomogeneously ordered arrangement in which the block variables have a\nrandom (Gaussian) distribution centred on the order parameter\n(@fig-c1(biv)).\n\nConsider now the situation *at* the critical point. @fig-c2(ai) shows a\ntypical arrangement; @fig-c2(aii) and (aiii) show the results of coarse-graining\nwith $L=4$ and $L=8$ respectively. Since the $\\xi$ is as large as the\nsystem itself the coarse graining does not produce less critical\nrepresentations of the physical system: each of the figures displays\nstructure over *all* length scales between the lower limit set by $L$\nand the upper limit set by the size of the display itself. A limiting\ntrend is nevertheless apparent. Although the $L=4$ pattern is\nqualitatively quite different from the pattern of the local variables,\nthe $L=4$ and $L=8$ patterns display qualitatively similar features.\nThese similarities are more profound than is immediately apparent. A\nstatistical analysis of the spectrum of $L=4$ configurations (generated\nas the local variables evolve in time) show that it is almost identical\nto that of the $L=8$ configurations (given the block variable scaling).\nThe implication of this limiting behaviour is clear: the patterns formed\nby the ordering variable at criticality look the same (in a statistical\nsense) when viewed on all sufficiently large length scales.\n\n\n::: {layout=\"[[1,1],[1,1], [1,1], [1]]\" #fig-c2}\n![(ai)](Figs/a1_3state.png){width=50%}\n\n![(bi)](Figs/b1_3state.png){width=50%}\n\n![(aii)](Figs/a2_3state.png){width=50%}\n\n![(bii)](Figs/b2_3state.png){width=50%}\n\n![(aiii)](Figs/a3_3state.png){width=50%}\n\n![(biii)](Figs/b3_3state.png){width=50%}\n\n![(iv)](Figs/scaled_block_variable.png){width=60%}\n\nSee text for details\n:::\n\nLet us summarize. Under the coarse-graining operation there is an\nevolution or *flow* of the system's configuration spectrum. The flow\ntends to a limit, or fixed point, such that the pattern spectrum does\nnot change under further coarse-graining. These scale-invariant limits\nhave a trivial character for $T>T_c$, (a perfectly disordered\narrangement) and $T< T_c$, (a perfectly ordered arrangement). The hallmark of the critical\npoint is the existence of a scale-invariant limit which is neither fully\nordered nor fully disordered but which possesses structure on all length\nscales. A nice illustration of critical point scale invariance in the Ising model can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi-g2ET97W8&ab_channel=DouglasAshton).\n\n## Universality and Scaling\n\nEquipped with the coarse-graining technique, we now address the\nuniversality phenomenon. We aim to understand how it is that systems\nthat are different microscopically can nevertheless display critical\npoint behaviour which (in certain respects) is quantitatively identical.\n\nTo obtain initial insight we introduce a spin-1 Ising model in which the\nspins take on three values ($s_i=1,0,-1$), in contrast to the two values\n($s_i=1,-1$) of the spin-1/2 Ising model. The two models have properties\nwhich are different: for example, $T_c$ for the three-state model is\nsome $30\\%$ lower than that of the two-state model (for the same\ncoupling $J$). However, there is abundant evidence that the two models\nhave the same universal properties.\n\nLet us explore what is the same and what is different in the\nconfigurations of the two models at criticality. The configurations of\nthe local variables $s_i$ are clearly qualitatively different for the\ntwo models. Now consider the coarse-grained configurations (with $L=4$\nand $L=8$ respectively) for the three-state model at the critical point.\nWe have already seen that the coarse-graining operation bears the\nconfiguration spectrum of the critical two-state Ising model to a\nnon-trivial scale-invariant limit. It is scarcely surprising that the\nsame is true for the three-state model. What is remarkable is that the\ntwo limits are the same! This is expressed in @fig-c2(iv), which\nshows the near coincidence of the distribution of block variables\n(grey-levels) for the two different coarse-graining lengths. Thus the\ncoarse-graining erases the physical differences apparent in\nconfigurations where the local behaviour is resolvable, and exposes a\nprofound configurational similarity.\n\n### Fluid-magnet universality\n\nLet us now turn to fluid-magnet universality. In a magnet, the relevant\nconfigurations are those formed by the coarse-grained magnetisation (the\nmagnetic moment averaged over a block of side $L$). In a fluid, the\nrelevant configurations are those of the coarse-grained density (the\nmass averaged over a block if side $L$) or more precisely, its\nfluctuation from its macroscopic average (@fig-fmcoarse). The patterns in the latter (bubbles of\nliquid or vapour) may be matched to pattern in the former (microdomains\nof the magnetisation), given appropriate scaling operations to\ncamouflage the differences between the length scales and the differences\nbetween the variable scales.\n\n\n\n![Schematic representation of the coarse graining operation via which the universal properties of fluids and magnets may be exposed.](Figs/coarse.png){#fig-fmcoarse width=50%}\n\n\n\nThe results is illustrated in @fig-confscomp. \n\n::: {#fig-confscomp layout-ncol=1}\n![2D critical Ising model and 2d critical Lennard-Jones fluid at small lengthscales](Figs/fluid-magnet.png){width=50%}\n\n![Same models as above, but viewed at large lengthscales](Figs/fluid-magnet2.png){width=50%}\n\n\nSnapshot configurations of the 2D critical Ising model\n(left) and the 2D critical Lennard-Jones fluid (right). When viewed on\nsufficiently large length scales the configurational patterns appear\nuniversal and self similar.\n:::\n\nA movie in which we progressively zoom out shows how the loss of microscopic details reveals the large lengthscale universal features.\n{{< video Movies/universality.mov title=\"Zooming out\">}}\n\n## Near critical scaling\n\nThe similarity of coarse-grained configurations of different systems is\nnot restricted to the critical temperature itself. Suppose we have a two\nstate spin model and a three state spin model each somewhat above their\ncritical points at reduced temperature $t$. The two systems will have\nsomewhat different correlation lengths, $\\xi_1$ and $\\xi_2$ say. Suppose\nhowever, we choose coarse-graining lengths $L_1$ for $L_2$ for the two\nmodels such that $\\xi_1/L_1=\\xi_2/L_2$. We adjust the scales of the\nblock variables (our grey level control) so that the typical variable\nvalue is the same for the two systems. We adjust the length scale of the\nsystems (stretch or shrink our snapshots) so that the sizes of the\nminimum-length-scale structure (set by $L_1$ and $L_2$) looks the same\nfor each system. Precisely what they look like depends upon our choice\nof $\\xi/L$.\n\n## Universality classes {#sec-unipics}\n\nCoarse graining does not erase all differences between the physical\nproperties of critical systems. Differences in the space dimension $d$\nof two critical systems will lead to different universal properties such\nas critical exponents. Thus, for instance, the critical exponents of the\n2D magnet, match those of the 2d fluid, but they are different to those\nof 3d magnets and fluids.\n\nIn fact the space dimension is one of a small set of qualitative\nfeatures of a critical system which are sufficiently deep-seated to\nsurvive coarse graining and which together serve to define the system's\nuniversal behaviour, or *universality class*. The constituents of this\nset are not all identifiable *a priori*. They include the number of\ncomponents $n$ of the order parameter. Up to now, we have only\nconsidered order parameters which are scalar (for a fluid the density,\nfor a magnet the magnetisation), for which $n=1$. In some ferromagnets,\nthe order parameter may have components along two axes, or three axes,\nimplying a vector order parameter, with $n=2$ or $n=3$, respectively. It\nis clear that the order-parameter $n$-value will be reflected in the\nnature of the coarse-grained configurations, and thus in the universal\nobservables they imply.\n\nA third important feature which can change the universality class of a\ncritical system is the range of the interaction potential between its\nconstituent particles. Clearly for the Ising model, interactions between\nspins are inherently nearest neighbour in character. Most fluids\ninteract via dispersion forces (such as the Lennard-Jones potential)\nwhich is also short ranged owing to the $r^{-6}$ attractive interaction.\nHowever some systems have much longer ranged interactions. Notable here\nare systems of charged particles which interact via a Coulomb potential.\nThe long ranged nature of the Coulomb potential (which decays like\n$r^{-1}$) means that charged systems often do not have the same critical\nexponents as the Ising model and fluid.\n\n## Critical exponents\n\nWe consider now how the critical exponents, may be computed via the\ncoarse-graining procedure. In what follows we will refer only to the\nbehaviour of a single typical coarse grained variable, which we shall\ndenote $S(L)$. We suppose that $t$ is sufficiently small that $\\xi \\gg\nL_\\textrm{ min}$. Universality and scaling may be expressed in the claim\nthat, for *any* $L$ and $t$, scale factors $a(L)$ and $b(L)$ may be\nfound such that the probability distribution $p(S(L),t)$ can be written\nin the form\n\n$$\np(S(L),t)=b(L)\\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)\n$${#eq-blocks}\nwhere $\\tilde{p}$ is a function unique to a universality class. \nThe role of the scale factors $a$ and $b$ is to\nabsorb the basic non-universal scales identified in\n@sec-rgmethod. The critical exponents are implicit in the\n$L$-dependence of these scale factors. Specifically one finds:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na(L) & =a_0L^{1/\\nu} \\\\\nb(L) & =b_0L^{\\beta/\\nu}\n\\end{aligned} \n$${#eq-scalefacs}\nwhere the amplitudes $a_0$ and $b_0$ are system specific (non-universal) constants.\n\nThese results state that the critical exponents (in the form $1/\\nu$ and\n$\\beta/\\nu$) characterize the ways in which the configuration spectrum\nevolves under coarse-graining. Consider, first the exponent ratio\n$\\beta/\\nu$. Precisely at the critical point, there is only one way in\nwhich the coarse-grained configurations change with $L$: the overall\nscale of the coarse-grained variable (the black-white contrast in our\ngrey scale representation) is eroded with increasing $L$. Thus the\nconfigurations of coarse-graining length $L_1$ match those of a larger\ncoarse-graining length $L_2$ only if the variable scale in the latter\nconfigurations is amplified. The required amplification follows from\n@eq-blocks and and @eq-scalefacs: it is\n\n$$\n\\frac{b(L_2)}{b(L_1)}=\\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_1}\\right)^{\\beta/\\nu}\\:.\n$$\nThe exponent ratio $\\beta/\\nu$ thus controls the rate at which the scale\nof the ordering variable decays with increasing coarse-graining length.\n\nConsider now the exponent $1/\\nu$. For small but non-zero reduced\ntemperature (large but finite $\\xi$) there is second way in which the\nconfiguration spectrum evolves with $L$. As noted previously, coarse\ngraining reduces the ratio of correlation length to coarse-graining\nlength, and results in configurations with a less critical appearance.\nMore precisely, we see from @eq-blocks that increasing the coarse graining length from\n$L_1$ to $L_2$ while keeping the reduced temperature constant has the\nsame effect on the configuration spectrum as keeping coarse-graining\nlength constant which amplifying the reduced temperature $t$ by a factor\n\n$$\n\\frac{a(L_2)}{a(L_1)}=\\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_1}\\right)^{1/\\nu}\\:.\n$$ One\nmay think of the combination $a(L)t$ as a measure of the effective\nreduced temperature of the physical system viewed with resolution length\n$L$. The exponent $1/\\nu$ controls the rate at which the effective\nreduced temperature flows with increasing coarse-graining length.\n\n## Finite-size scaling {#sec-fss}\n\nWe can exploit the fact that the scale factors $a(L)$ and $b(L)$ depend\non critical exponents to estimate the values of these exponents using\ncomputer simulation. Consider the average of the block variable $S(L)$.\nConsideration of @eq-blkvar shows that this is non other than the value of\nthe order parameter $Q$, measured over a block of side $L$. Thus from\nthe definition of an average\n\n$$\nQ(L,t)=\\bar {S}(L,t)=\\int S(L)p(S(L),t)dS(L)\n$$ where $p(S(L))$ is the\nprobability distribution of $S(L)$.\n\nMaking use of the representation of @eq-blocks, we then have that\n\n$$Q\n(L,t) = \\int b(L)S(L)\\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)dS(L)\n$$\n\nTo integrate this we need to change the integration variable from $S(L)$\nto $b(L)S(L)$. We have $d(b(L)S(L))=b(L)dS(L)$ since $b(L)$ does not\nfluctuate. Thus\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ(L,t)  & =  b^{-1}(L)\\int b(L)S(L)\\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)d(b(L)S(L))\\nonumber\\\\\n        & =  b^{-1}(L)f(a(L)t)\\nonumber\\\\\n       & =  b_0L^{-\\beta/\\nu}f(a_0L^{1/\\nu}t)\n\\end{aligned} where $f$ is a universal function (defined as the first\nmoment of $\\tilde{p}(x,y)$ with respect to $y$).\n\nThe above results provide a method for determining the critical exponent\nratios $\\beta/\\nu$ and $1/\\nu$ via computer simulations of near critical\nsystems. For instance, at the critical point ($t=0$) and for finite\nblock size, $Q(L,0)$ will not be zero (the $T$ at which Q vanishes for\nfinite $L$ is above the true $T_c$, cf. @sec-compsim.\nHowever, we know that its value must vanish in the limit of infinite\n$L$; it does so like\n\n$$Q(L,0)=b_0L^{-\\beta/\\nu}f(0)\\equiv Q_0L^{-\\beta/\\nu}$$\n\nThus by studying the critical point $L$ dependence of $Q$ we can\nestimate $\\beta/\\nu$. A similar approach in which we study two block\nsizes $L$, and tune $t$ separately in each case so that the results for\n$QL^{\\beta/\\nu}$ are identical provides information on the value of\n$1/\\nu$.\n\n## Summary of main points\nAs this is quite a long chapter let us summarise the main points: \n\n\n- **Limitations of conventional theories**: Mean field theories and the scaling hypothesis are insufficient in the critical region due to their neglect of correlations across all relevant length scales.\n\n- **Critical region characteristics**: Near-critical systems exhibit correlated microstructure on all length scales up to the correlation length. The complexity of this structure makes both analytical and computational study challenging.\n\n- **Relevant length scales**:\n  1. Correlation length ($\\xi$)\n  2. Minimum microscopic scale ($L_\\textrm{min}$)\n  3. Macroscopic system size ($L_\\textrm{max}$)\n\n- **Window Condition for criticality**: The true critical regime satisfies $L_\\textrm{max} \\gg \\xi \\gg L_\\textrm{min}$, encompassing a broad range of scales where complex, often fractal-like, structures are present.\n\n- **Renormalisation Group (RG) methodology**: RG involves the stepwise elimination of degrees of freedom by coarse-graining the system over increasing length scales. A fourth scale, $L$, represents the resolution at which the system is described.\n\n- **Effect of coarse-graining**: Coarse-graining changes the effective reduced temperature, captured by the relation $a(L)t$, where $a(L)$ scales with $L$ as $L^{1/\\nu}$. This helps describe how critical configurations evolve with resolution.\n\n- **Universality**:\n  - Coarse-graining reveals that microscopically different systems can exhibit identical critical behavior when observed at large scales.\n  - The concept of universality explains why disparate systems, such as magnets and fluids, can show the same critical exponents and scaling laws.\n  - Critical behavior depends primarily on general features like dimensionality and symmetry, rather than microscopic details.\n\n\n- **Finite-Size scaling**:\n  - The average block variable $Q(L,t)$ is related to block size $L$ and reduced temperature $t$ through scaling relations. Computer simulations exploit this to extract scaling functions and the values of critical exponents. \n    \n\n## Addendum: The effective coupling viewpoint of the renormalization group (non examinable) \n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Notes for those interested in a different perspective on RG theory.\n\nLet us begin by returning to our fundamental @eq-probs,\nwhich we rewrite as\n\n$$p = Z^{-1}e^{-{\\cal H}}$$ where ${\\cal H}\\equiv E/k_BT$.\n\nThe first step is then to imagine that we generate, by a computer\nsimulation procedure for example, a sequence of configurations with\nrelative probability $\\exp(-{\\cal H})$. We next adopt some\ncoarse-graining procedure which produces from these original\nconfigurations a set of coarse-grained configurations. We then ask the\nquestion: what is the energy function ${\\cal H}^\\prime$ of the\ncoarse-grained variables which would produce these coarse-grained\nconfigurations with the correct relative probability\n$\\exp(-{\\cal H}^\\prime)$? Clearly the form of ${\\cal H}^\\prime$ depends\non the form of ${\\cal H}$ thus we can write symbolically\n\n$${\\cal H}^\\prime=R({\\cal H})$$\n\nThe operation $R$, which defines the coarse-grained configurational\nenergy in terms of the microscopic configurational energy function is\nknown as a renormalisation group transformation (RGT). What it does is\nto replace a hard problem by a less hard problem. Specifically, suppose\nthat our system is near a critical point and that we wish to calculate\nits large-distance properties. If we address this task by utilizing the\nconfigurational energy and appealing to the basic machinery of\nstatistical mechanics set out in @eq-probs and @eq-partition, the problem is hard. It is hard because the\nsystem has fluctuations on all the (many) length scales intermediate\nbetween the correlation length $\\xi$ and the minimum length scale\n$L_\\textrm{min}$.\n\nHowever, the task may instead be addressed by tackling the\ncoarse-grained system described by the energy ${\\cal H}^\\prime$. The\nlarge-distance properties of this system are the same as the\nlarge-distance properties of the physical system, since coarse-graining\noperation preserves large-scale configurational structure. In this\nrepresentation the problem is a little easier: while the $\\xi$\nassociated with ${\\cal H}^\\prime$ is the same as the $\\xi$ associated\nwith ${\\cal H}$, the minimum length scale of ${\\cal H}^\\prime$ is bigger\nthan that of ${\\cal H}$. Thus the statistical mechanics of\n${\\cal H}^\\prime$ poses a not-quite-so-many-length-scale problem, a\nproblem which is effectively a little less critical and is thus a little\neasier to solve. The benefits accruing from this procedure may be\namplified by repeating it. Repeated application of $R$ will eventually\nresult in a coarse- grained energy function describing configurations in\nwhich the $\\xi$ is no bigger than the minimum length scale. The\nassociated system is far from criticality and its properties may be\nreliably computed by any of a wide variety of approximation schemes.\nThese properties are the desired large-distance properties of the\nphysical system. As explicit reference to fluctuations of a given scale\nis eliminated by coarse-graining, their effects are carried forward\nimplicitly in the parameters of the coarse-grained energy.\n\nIn order to setup the framework for a simple illustrative example, let\nis return to the lattice Ising model for which the energy function\ndepended only on the product of nearest neighbour spins. The coefficient\nof this product in the energy is the exchange coupling, $J$. In\nprinciple, however, other kinds of interactions are also allowed; for\nexample, we may have a product of second neighbour spins with strength\n$J_2$ or, perhaps, a product of four spins (at sites forming a square\nwhose side is the lattice spacing), with strength $J_3$. Such\ninteractions in a real magnet have their origin in the quantum mechanics\nof the atoms and electrons and clearly depend upon the details of the\nsystem. For generality therefore we will allow a family of exchange\ncouplings $J_1$,$J_2$,$J_3,\\dots$, or $J_a, a =\n1,2,\\dots$ In reduced units, the equivalent coupling strengths are\n$K_a =J_a/k_BT$. Their values determine uniquely the energy for any\ngiven configuration.\n    \n> We note that it is not only useful to allow for arbitrary kinds of interactions: if we wish to repeat the transformation several\n(indeed many) times, it is also necessary because even if we start with only the nearest neighbour coupling in ${\\cal H}$ the transformation will in general produce others in ${\\cal H}^\\prime$.\n\nNow consider the coarse-graining procedure. Let us suppose that this\nprocedure takes the form of a 'majority rule' operation in which the new\nspins are assigned values $+1$ or $-1$ according to the signs of the\nmagnetic moments of the blocks with which they are associated. The new\nenergy function ${\\cal H}^\\prime$ will be expressible in terms of some\nnew coupling strengths $K^\\prime$ describing the interactions amongst\nthe new spin variables (and thus, in effect, the interactions between\nblocks of the original spin variables). The RGT simply states that these\nnew couplings depend on the old couplings: $K_1^\\prime$ is some function\n$f_1$ of all the original couplings, and generally\n\n$$K^\\prime_a=f_a(K_1,K_2,\\dots) =f_a({\\bf K}),~~~~ a= 1, 2,\\dots\n$${#eq-rgt} where **K** is shorthand for the set $K_1, K_2,\\dots$\n\n### A simple example\n\nThis example illustrates how one can perform the RG transformation @eq-rgt\ndirectly, without recourse to a 'sequence of typical configurations'.\nThe calculation involves a very crude approximation which has the\nadvantage that it simplifies the subsequent analysis.\n\n![Coarse graining by decimation. The spins on the original lattice are\ndivided into two sets $\\{s^\\prime\\}$ and $\\{\\tilde{s}\\}$. The\n$\\{s^\\prime\\}$ spins occupy a lattice whose spacing is twice that of the\noriginal. The effective coupling interaction between the $\\{s^\\prime\\}$\nspins is obtained by performing the configurational average over the\n$\\{\\tilde{s}\\}$ ](Figs/rglat.png){#fig-rglat width=40%}\n\nConsider an Ising model in two dimensions, with only nearest neighbour\ninteractions as shown in @fig-rglat. We have divided the spins into two sets, the\nspins $\\{s^\\prime\\}$ form a square lattice of spacing $2$, the others\nbeing denoted by $\\{\\tilde{s}\\}$. One then defines an effective energy\nfunction ${\\cal H^\\prime}$ for the $s^\\prime$ spins by performing an\naverage over all the possible arrangements of the $\\tilde{s}$ spins\n\n$$\n\\exp(-{\\cal H}^\\prime)=\\sum_{\\{\\tilde {s}\\}} \\exp(-{\\cal H}).\n$${#eq-decimate}\n\nThis particular coarse-graining scheme is called 'decimation' because a\ncertain fraction (not necessarily one-tenth!) of spins on the lattice is\neliminated. This formulation of a new energy function realizes two basic\naims of the RG method: the long-distance physics of the 'original'\nsystem, described by ${\\cal H}$, is contained in that of the 'new'\nsystem, described by ${\\cal H}^\\prime$ (indeed the partition functions\nare the same as one can see by summing both sides over $s^\\prime$) and\nthe new system is further from critically because the ratio of $\\xi$ to\nlattice spacing ('minimum length scale') has been reduced by a factor of\n$1/2$ (the ratio of the lattice spacings of the two systems). We must\nnow face the question of how to perform the configuration sum in @eq-decimate. This cannot in general be done exactly, so we\nmust resort to some approximation scheme. The particular approximation\nwhich we invoke is the high temperature series expansion. In its simplest mathematical form, since\n${\\cal H}$ contains a factor $1/k_BT$, it involves the expansion of\n$\\exp(-{\\cal H})$ as a power series:\n\n$$\\exp(-{\\cal H}/k_BT)=1-{\\cal H}/k_BT +\\frac{1}{2!}({\\cal H}/k_BT)^2+.....$$\n\nWe substitute this expansion into the right hand side of @eq-decimate\nand proceed to look for terms which depend on\nthe $s^\\prime$ spins after the sum over the possible arrangements of the\n$\\tilde{s}$ spins is performed. This sum extends over all the possible\n($\\pm 1$) values of all the $\\tilde{s}$ spins. The first term (the 1) in\nthe expansion of the exponential is clearly independent of the values of\nthe $s^\\prime$ spins. The second term (${\\cal H}$) is a function of the\n$s^\\prime$ spins, but gives zero when the sum over the $s^\\prime$ spins\nis performed because only a single factor of any $s^\\prime$ ever\nappears, and $+ 1 - 1 = 0$. The third term (${\\cal H}^2/2$) does\ncontribute. If one writes out explicitly the form of ${\\cal H}^2/2$ one\nfinds terms of the form\n$K^2s_1^\\prime\\tilde{s}\\tilde{s}s_2^\\prime=K^2s_1^\\prime s_2^\\prime$,\nwhere $s_1^\\prime$ and $s_2^\\prime$ denote two spins at nearest\nneighbour sites on the lattice of $s^\\prime$ spins and $\\tilde{s}$ is\nthe spin (in the other set) which lies between them. Now, in the\ncorresponding expansion of the left hand side of @eq-decimate, we find terms of the form\n$K^\\prime s_1^\\prime s_2^\\prime$, where $K^\\prime$ is the nearest\nneighbour coupling for the $s^\\prime$ spins. We conclude (with a little\nmore thought than we detail here) that\n\n$$\nK^\\prime=K^2\n$${#eq-rgdec}\n\nOf course many other terms and couplings are generated by the higher\norders of the high temperature expansion and it is necssary to include\nthese if one wishes reliable values for the critical temperature and\nexponents, However, our aim here is to use this simple calculation to\nillustrate the RG method. Let us therefore close our eyes, forget about\nthe higher order terms and show how the RGT @eq-rgdec can be used to obtain information on the phase\ntransition.\n\n![Coupling flow under the decimation transformation described in the text.](Figs/flow1.png){#fig-flow1 width=60%}\n\nThe first point to note is that that mathematically @eq-rgdec\nhas the fixed point $K^*= 1$; if $K= 1$ then the new effective coupling\n$K^\\prime$ has the same value $1$. Further, if $K$ is just larger than\n$1$, then $K^\\prime$ is larger than $K$, i.e. further away from $1$.\nSimilarly, if $K$ is less than $1$, $K^\\prime$ is less than $K$. We say\nthat the fixed point is unstable: the flow of couplings under repeated\niteration of @eq-rgdec is away from the fixed point, as illustrated in\n@fig-flow1. The physical significance of this is as follows: suppose that the original\nsystem is at its critical point so that the ratio of $\\xi$ to lattice\nspacing is infinite. After one application of the decimation\ntransformation, the effective lattice spacing has increased by a factor\nof two, but this ratio remains infinite; the new system is therefore\nalso at its critical point. Within the approximations inherent in\n@eq-rgdec, the original system is an Ising model with\nnearest neighbour coupling $K$ and the new system is an Ising model with\nnearest neighbour coupling $K^\\prime$. If these two systems are going to\nbe at a common critically, we must identify $K^\\prime=\nK$. The fixed point $K^*= 1$ is therefore a candidate for the critical\npoint $K_c$, where the phase transition occurs. This interpretation is\nreinforced by considering the case where the original system is close\nto, but not at, criticality. Then $\\xi$ is finite and the new system is\nfurther from critically because the ratio of $\\xi$ to lattice spacing is\nreduced by a factor of two. This instability of a fixed point to\ndeviations of $K$ from $K^*$ is a further necessary condition for its\ninterpretation as a critical point of the system. In summary then we\nmake the prediction\n\n$$\nK_c=J/k_BT_c=1\n$${#eq-Kc}\n\nWe can obtain further information about the behaviour of the system\nclose to its critical point. In order to do so, we rewrite the \ntransformation (@eq-rgdec) in terms of the deviation of the coupling from\nits fixed point value. A Taylor expansion of the function $K^\\prime=K^2$\nyields\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nK^\\prime =& (K^*)^2 +(K-K^*)\\left.\\frac{\\partial K^\\prime}{\\partial K}\\right|_{K=K^*}+\\frac{1}{2}(K-K^*)^2\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 K^\\prime}{\\partial K^2}\\right|_{K=K^*}+\\ldots\\nonumber\\\\\nK^\\prime - K^* =& 2 (K - K^*)+ (K - K^*)^2 \n\\end{aligned} where in the second line we have used the fact that the\nfirst derivative evaluates to $2K^*=2$ and $(K^*)^2=K^*$.\n\nFor a system sufficiently close to its critical temperature the final\nterm can be neglected. The deviation of the coupling from its fixed\npoint (critical) value is thus bigger for the new system than it is for\nthe old by a factor of two. This means that the reduced temperature is\nalso bigger by a factor of two:\n\n$$t^\\prime= 2t$$\n\nBut $\\xi$ (in units of the appropriate lattice spacing) is smaller by a\nfactor of $1/2$:\n\n$$\\xi^\\prime= \\xi/2$$\n\nThus, when we double $t$, we halve $\\xi$, implying that\n\n$$\\xi\\propto t^{-1}$$\n\nfor $T$ close to $T_c$. Thus we see that the RGT predicts scaling\nbehaviour with calculable critical exponents. In this simple calculation\nwe estimate the critical exponent $\\nu=1$ for the square lattice Ising\nmodel. This prediction is actually in agreement with the exactly\nestablished value. The agreement is fortuitous- the prediction in\nEq. refeq:Kc for $K_c$, is larger than the exactly established value by\na factor of more than two. In order to obtain reliable estimates more\nsophisticated and systematic methods must be used.\n\nThe crude approximation in the calculation above produced a\ntransformation, @eq-rgdec, involving only the nearest neighbour coupling,\nwith the subsequent advantages of simple algebra. We pay a penalty for\nthis simplicity in two ways: the results obtained for critical\nproperties are in rather poor agreement with accepted values, and we\ngain no insight into the origin of universality.\n\n### Universality and scaling\n\nIn order to expose how universality can arise, we should from the start\nallow for several different kinds of coupling $J_a$, and show how the\nsystems with *different* $J_a$ can have the *same* critical behaviour.\n\n![General flow in coupling space](Figs/flow2.png){#fig-flow2 width=80%}\n\n@fig-flow2 is a representation of the space of all coupling strengths $K_a$ in the\nenergy function ${\\cal H}/k_BT$. This is of course actually a space of\ninfinite dimension, but representing three of these, as we have done,\nenables us to illustrate all the important aspects. First let us be\nclear what the points in this space represent. Suppose we have some\nmagnetic material which is described by a given set of exchange\nconstants $J_1,J_2,J_3.....$ As the temperature $T$ varies, the coupling\nstrengths $K_a=J_a/k_BT$ trace out a straight line, or ray, from the\norigin of the space in the direction ($J_1,J_2,J_3 ....$ ). Points on\nthis ray close to the origin represent this magnet at high temperatures,\nand conversely points far from the origin represent the magnet at low\ntemperatures. The critical point of the magnet is represented by a\nspecific point on this ray, $K_a=\nJ_a/k_BT, a= 1,2,\\dots$ The set of critical points on all of the\npossible rays forms a *surface*, the critical surface. Formally, it is\ndefined by the set of all possible models (of the Ising type) which have\ninfinite $\\xi$. It is shown schematically as the shaded surface in\n@fig-flow2. (In the figure it is a two-dimensional surface; more generally it has one\ndimension less than the full coupling constant space, dividing all\nmodels into high and low temperature phases.)\n\nOur immediate goal then is to understand how the RGT can explain why\ndifferent physical systems near this critical surface have the same\nbehaviour. Let us turn now to the schematic representation of the RG\nflow in @fig-flow2. Suppose we start with a physical system, with\ncoupling strengths $K_a,  a= 1,2, \\dots$. What the RGT does is generate\na new point in the figure, at the coupling strengths\n$K_a^{(1)}=f_a({\\bf K})$; these are the couplings appearing in the\neffective energy function describing the coarse-grained system. If we\nrepeat the transformation, the new energy function has coupling\nstrengths $K_a^{(2)}=f_a({\\bf K})$. Thus repeated application of the\ntransformation generates a flow of points in the figure: ${\\bf K\\to\nK^{(1)}\\to\\dots\\to K^{(n)}}$ where the superscript ($n$) labels the\neffective couplings after $n$ coarse-graining steps. if the change in\ncoarse-graining scale is $b$ ($> 1$) at each step, the total change in\ncoarse-graining scale is $b^n$ after $n$ steps. In the process,\ntherefore, the ratio of $\\xi$ to coarse-graining scale is reduced by a\nfactor of $b^{-n}$. The dots in @fig-flow2\nidentify three lines of RG flow starting from three systems differing\nonly in their temperature. (The flow lines are schematic but display the\nessential features revealed in detailed calculations.)\n\nConsider first the red dots which start from the nearest neighbour Ising\nmodel at its critical point. The ratio of $\\xi$ to coarse-graining scale\nis reduced by a factor b at each step, but, since it starts infinite, it\nremains infinite after any finite number of steps. In this case we can\nin principle generate an unbounded number of dots,\n${\\bf K^{(1)}, K^{(2)},\\dots,K^{(n)}}$, all of which lie in the critical\nsurface. The simplest behaviour of such a sequence as $n$ increases is\nto tend to a limit, $K^*$, say. In such a case\n\n$$K^*_a=f_a(K^*)~~~~ a= 1,2 .....$$\n\nThis point ${\\bf K^*} \\equiv K_1^*, K_2^*, \\dots$ is therefore a *fixed\npoint* which lies in the critical surface.\n\nBy contrast, consider the same magnet as before, now at temperature $T$\njust greater than $T_c$, its couplings $K_a$, will be close to the first\nred dot (in fact they will be slightly smaller) and so will the\neffective couplings $K_a^{(1)},K_2^{(2)},\\dots$ of the corresponding\ncoarse-grained systems. The new flow will therefore appear initially to\nfollow the red dots towards the same fixed point. However, the flow must\neventually move away from the fixed point because each coarse-graining\nnow produces a model further from criticality. The resulting flow is\nrepresented schematically by one set of black dots. The other set of\nblack dots shows the expected flow starting from the same magnet\nslightly below its critical temperature.\n\nWe are now in a position to understand both universality and scaling\nwithin this framework. We will suppose that there exists a single fixed\npoint in the critical surface which sucks in all flows starting from a\npoint in that surface. Then any system at its critical point will\nexhibit large-length scale physics (large-block spin behaviour)\ndescribed by the single set of fixed point coupling constants. The\nuniqueness of this limiting set of coupling constants is the essence of\ncritical point universality. It is, of course, the algebraic counterpart\nof the unique limiting spectrum of coarse-grained configurations,\ndiscussed in @sec-unipics. Similarly the scale-invariance of the critical\npoint configuration spectrum (viewed on large enough length scales) is\nexpressed in the invariance of the couplings under iteration of the\ntransformation (after a number of iterations large enough to secure\nconvergence to the fixed point).\n\nTo understand the behaviour of systems near but not precisely at\ncritically we must make a further assumption (again widely justified by\nexplicit studies). The flow line stemming from any such system will, we\nhave argued, be borne towards the fixed point before ultimately\ndeviating from it after a number of iterations large enough to expose\nthe system's noncritical character. We assume that (as indicated\nschematically in the streams of red and blue lines in @fig-flow2\nthe deviations lie along a single line through the fixed point, the\ndirection followed along this line differing according to the sign of\nthe temperature deviation $T-T_c$. Since any two sets of coupling\nconstants on the line (on the same side of the fixed point) are related\nby a suitable coarse-graining operation, this picture implies that the\nlarge-length-scale physics of all near- critical systems differs only in\nthe matter of a length scale. This is the essence of near-critical point\nuniversality.\n\n\n:::\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"live-html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"live-html","base-format":"html","extension-name":"live"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["/Users/ft14968/Repos/course-disordered-matter/quarto/_extensions/r-wasm/live/live.lua"],"toc":true,"output-file":"rg.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
