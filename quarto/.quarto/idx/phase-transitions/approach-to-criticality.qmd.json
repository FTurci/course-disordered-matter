Let us remain with the archetypal example of\na critical system, the ferromagnet, whose critical temperature will be\ndenoted as $T_c$. For temperatures close to $T_c$, the magnetic response\nfunctions (the magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$ and the specific heat) are\nfound to be singular functions, diverging as a *power* of the reduced\n(dimensionless) temperature $t \\equiv\n(T-T_c)/T_c$:-\n\n$$\n\\chi \\equiv \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial H}\\propto t^{-\\gamma} ~~~~ (H=0) \n$${#eq-chipow}\n\n(where $M=mN$),\n$$\nC_H \\equiv \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial T}\\propto t^{-\\alpha} ~~~~ (H=\\textrm{ constant}) \n$${#eq-Cv}\n\nAnother key quantity is the correlation length $\\xi$, which measures the\ndistance over which fluctuations of the magnetic moments are correlated.\nThis is observed to diverge near the critical point with an exponent\n$\\nu$.\n\n$$\n\\xi \\propto t^{-\\nu} ~~~~ (T > T_c,\\: H=0)\n$${#eq-corr}\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" title=\"More on correlations\"}\n\nThe two-point correlation function measures how fluctuations at two spatial points are statistically related. For a scalar field $\\phi(\\vec{R})$, which could represent eg. the local magnetisation $m$ in a magnet at position vector $\\vec{R}$, or the local particle number density $\\rho$ in a fluid, it is defined as:\n\n$$\nC(r) = \\langle \\phi(\\vec{R}) \\phi(\\vec{R} + \\vec{r}) \\rangle - \\langle \\phi(\\vec{R}) \\rangle^2,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes an ensemble or spatial average over all $\\vec{R}$, and $r = |\\vec{r}|$ is the spatial separation between the two points.\n\n$C(r)$ quantifies the spatial extent over which field values are correlated and in homogeneous and isotropic systems,  it depends only on the separation $r$.\n\nIf $C(r)$ decays quickly, we say that correlations are short-ranged. Typically this occurs well away from criticality and takes the form of exponential decay\n\n  $$\n  C(r) \\sim e^{-r/\\xi}\n  $$\nwhere correlation length $\\xi$ is the characteristic scale over which correlations decay.\n\n\nNear a critical point $C(r)$ decays more slowly - in a power-law fashion - and correlations are long-ranged.\n\n  $$\n  C(r) \\sim r^{-(d - 2 + \\eta)}\n  $$\n  where $d$ is the spatial dimension and $\\eta$ is a critical exponent.\n\nExperimentally one doesn't typically have direct access to $C(r)$, but rather its Fourier transform known as the **structure factor**\n\n$$\nS(k) = \\int d^d r \\, e^{-i \\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{r}} \\, C(r),\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the scattering wavevector. \n\nIn equilibrium:\n\n- For short-range correlations (finite $\\xi$), $S(k)$ typically has a Lorentzian form:\n  $$\n  S(k) \\sim \\frac{1}{k^2 + \\xi^{-2}}.\n  $$\n\n- At criticality (where $\\xi \\to \\infty$), $S(k)$ follows a power law:\n  $$\n  S(k) \\sim k^{-2 + \\eta}.\n  $$\n\nThis relation enables the extraction of $\\xi$ from experimental or simulation data, especially via scattering techniques.\n\n:::\n\n\nSimilar power law behaviour is found for the order parameter $Q$ (in\nthis case the magnetisation) which vanishes in a singular fashion (it\nhas infinite gradient) as the critical point is is approached as a\nfunction of temperature:\n\n$$\nm \\propto t^{\\beta} ~~~~ (T < T_c,\\: H=0) \n$${#eq-mag}\n(here the symbol $\\beta$, is not to be confused with $\\beta=1/k_BT$--\nthis unfortunately is the standard notation.)\n\nFinally, as a function of magnetic field:\n\n$$m \\propto h^{1/\\delta} ~~~~ (T = T_c,\\: H>0) .$${#eq-field}\nwith $h=(H-H_c)/H_c$, the reduced magnetic field.\n\nAs examples, the behaviour of the magnetisation and correlation length\nare plotted in @fig-sing  as a function of $t$.\n\n ![Singular behaviour of the correlation length and order parameter in the vicinity of the critical point as a function of the reduced temperature $t$.](Figs/sing_color.png){width=60% fig-align=\"center\" #fig-sing}\n\nThe quantities $\\gamma, \\alpha, \\nu, \\beta$ in the above equations are\nknown as critical exponents. They serve to control the rate at which the\nvarious thermodynamic quantities change on the approach to criticality.\n\nRemarkably, the form of singular behaviour observed at criticality for\nthe example ferromagnet also occurs in qualitatively quite different\nsystems such as the fluid. All that is required to obtain the\ncorresponding power law relationships for the fluid is to substitute the\nanalogous thermodynamic quantities in to the above equations.\nAccordingly the magnetisation order parameter is replaced by the density\ndifference $\\rho_{liq}-\\rho_{gas}$ while the susceptibility is replaced\nby the isothermal compressibility and the specific heat capacity at\nconstant field is replaced by the specific heat capacity at constant\nvolume. The approach to criticality in a variety of qualitatively quite\ndifferent systems can therefore be expressed in terms of a set of\ncritical exponents describing the power law behaviour for that system\n(see the book by Yeomans for examples).\n\nEven more remarkable is the experimental observation that the values of\nthe critical exponents for a whole range of fluids and magnets (and\nindeed many other systems with critical points) are *identical*. This is\nthe phenomenon of *universality*. It implies a deep underlying physical\nsimilarity between ostensibly disparate critical systems. The principal\naim of theories of critical point phenomena is to provide a sound\ntheoretical basis for the existence of power law behaviour, the factors\ngoverning the observed values of critical exponents and the universality\nphenomenon. Ultimately this basis is provided by the Renormalisation\nGroup (RG) theory, for which K.G. Wilson was awarded the Nobel Prize in\nPhysics in 1982.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"live-html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"live-html","base-format":"html","extension-name":"live"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["/Users/phxnw/Dropbox/course-disordered-matter/quarto/_extensions/r-wasm/live/live.lua"],"toc":true,"output-file":"approach-to-criticality.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
