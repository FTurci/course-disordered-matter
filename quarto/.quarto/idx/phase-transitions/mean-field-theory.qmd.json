In a very limited number of instances\nmodels have been solved exactly, yielding the phase coexistence\nparameters, critical exponents and the critical temperature. The 2-d\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ Ising model is certainly the most celebrated such\nexample, its principal critical exponents are found to be\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{8}, \\nu=1, \\gamma=\\frac{7}{4}$. Its critical temperature\nis $-2J/\\ln(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\approx 2.269J$. Unfortunately such solutions\nrarely afford deep insight to the general framework of criticality\nalthough they do act as an invaluable test-bed for new and existing\ntheories.\n\nThe inability to solve many models exactly often means that one must\nresort to approximations. One such approximation scheme is mean field\ntheory.\n\n## Mean field solution of the Ising model {#sec:mfising}\n\nLet us look for a mean field expression for the free energy of the Ising\nmodel whose Hamiltonian is given in @eq-ising .\nWrite\n\n$$s_i=\\langle s_i\\rangle+(s_i-\\langle s_i\\rangle)=m+(s_i-m)=m+\\delta s_i$$\n\nThen $$\\begin{aligned}\n{\\cal H}_I=&-J\\sum_{<i,j>}[m+(s_i-m)][m+(s_j-m)]-H\\sum_i s_i\\nonumber\\\\\n=&-J\\sum_{<i,j>}[m^2+m(s_i-m)+m(s_j-m)+\\delta s_i\\delta s_j]-H\\sum_i s_i\\nonumber\\\\\n=&-J\\sum_{i}(qms_i-qm^2/2)-H\\sum_i s_i-J\\sum_{<i,j>}\\delta s_i\\delta s_j \n\\end{aligned}$$ {#eq-mfa}\nwhere in the last line we have used the fact that when\nfor each site $i$ we perform the sum $\\sum_{<i,j>}$ over bonds of a\nquantity which is independent of $s_j$, then the result is just the\nnumber of bonds per site times that quantity. Since the number of bonds\non a lattice of $N$ sites of coordination $q$ is $Nq/2$ (because each\nbond is shared between two sites), there are therefore $q/2$ bonds per\nsite.\n\nNow the mean field approximation is to ignore the last term in the last line of @eq-mfa giving the configurational energy as\n\n$$\n{\\cal H}_{mf}=-\\sum_{i}H_{mf}s_i+NqJm^2/2\n$$ \nwith $H_{mf}\\equiv qJm+ H$ the \"mean field\" seen by spin $s_i$. As all the spins are decoupled\n(independent) in this approximation we can write down the partition\nfunction, which follows by taking the partition function for a single\nspin (by summing the Boltzmann factor for $s_i=\\pm 1$) and raising to\nthe power $N$ to find\n\n$$\nZ=e^{-\\beta qJm^2N/2}[2\\cosh(\\beta(qJm+H))]^N\n$$\n\nThe free energy follows as\n\n$$F(m)=NJqm^2/2-Nk_BT\\ln[2\\cosh(\\beta (qJm+H)]\\:.$$\n\nand the magnetisation as\n\n$$\nm=-\\frac{1}{N}\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial H}=\\tanh(\\beta(qJm+H))\n$$\n\nTo find $m(H,T)$, we must numerically solve this last equation self\nconsistently.\n\nNote that we can obtain $m$ in a different way. Consider some arbitary\nspin, $s_i$ say. Then this spin has an energy ${\\cal H}_{mf}(s_i)$.\nConsidering this energy for both cases $s_i=\\pm 1$ and the probability\n$p(s_i)=e^{-\\beta{\\cal H}_{mf}(s_i)}/Z$ of each, we have that\n\n$$\\langle s_i\\rangle=\\sum_{s_i=\\pm 1}s_ip(s_i)$$ but for consistancy,\n$\\langle s_i\\rangle=m$. Thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nm =& \\sum_{s_i=\\pm 1}s_ip(s_i)\\nonumber\\\\\n \\:=& \\frac{e^{\\beta(qJm+H)}-e^{\\beta(qJm+H)}} {e^{\\beta(qJm+H)}+e^{-\\beta(qJm+H)}}\\nonumber\\\\\n \\:=&\\tanh(\\beta(qJm+H))\n\\end{aligned}$${#eq-mfmag} as before.\n\n## Spontaneous symmetry breaking {#sec-breaking}\n\n\n ![Schematic of the form of the free energy for a critical, subcritical and supercritical temperature](Figs/freeenergy.png){width=70% fig-align=\"left\" #fig-freeenergy}\n\n\nThis mean field analysis reveals what is happening in the Ising model\nnear the critical temperature $T_c$.\n@fig-freeenergy shows sketches for $\\beta F(m)/N$ as a\nfunction of temperature, where for f simplicity we restrict attention to\n$H=0$. In this case $F(m)$ is symmetric in $m$, Moreover, at high $T$,\nthe entropy dominates and there is a single minimum in $F(m)$ at $m=0$.\nAs $T$ is lowered, there comes a point ($T=T_c=qJ/k_B$) where the\ncurvature of $F(m)$ at the origin changes sign; precisely at this point\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial m^2}=0.$$ At lower temperature, there are\ninstead two minima at nonzero $m=\\pm m^\\star$, where the *equilibrium\nmagnetisation* $m^\\star$ is the positive root (calculated explicitly\nbelow) of\n\n$$m^\\star=\\tanh(\\beta Jqm^\\star)= \\tanh(\\frac{m^\\star T_c}{T})$$ The\npoint $m=0$ which remains a root of this equation, is clearly an\nunstable point for $T<T_c$ (since $F$ has a maximum there).\n\nThis is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the absence of\nan external field, the Hamiltonian (and therefore the free energy) is\nsymmetric under $m\\to -m$. Accordingly, one might expect the actual\nstate of the system to also show this symmetry. This is true at high\ntemperature, but spontaneously breaks down at low ones. Instead there\nare a pair of ferromagnetic states (spins mostly up, or spins mostly\ndown) which -- by symmetry-- have the same free energy, lower than the\nunmagnetized state.\n\n## Phase diagram\n\nThe resulting zero-field magnetisation curve $m(T,H=0)$ looks like\n@fig-isingmag.\n\n ![Phase diagram of a simple magnet in the $m$-$T$ plane.](Figs/isingmag.png){width=70% fig-align=\"left\" #fig-isingmag}\n\n\nThis shows the sudden change of behaviour at $T_c$ (phase transition).\nFor $T<T_c$ it is arbitrary which of the two roots $\\pm m^\\star$ is\nchosen; typically it will be different in different parts of the sample\n(giving macroscopic \"magnetic domains\"). But this behaviour with\ntemperature is *qualitatively modified* by the presence of a field $H$,\nhowever small. In that case, there is always a slight magnetization,\neven far above $T_c$ and the curves becomes smoothed out, as shown.\nThere is no doubt which root will be chosen, and no sudden change of the\nbehaviour (no phase transition). Spontaneous symmetry breaking does not\noccur, because the symmetry is already broken by $H$. (The curve $F(m)$\nis lopsided, rather than symmetrical about $m=0$.)\n\nOn the other hand, if we sit below $T_c$ in a positive field (say) and\ngradually reduce $H$ through zero so that it becomes negative, there is\na *very* sudden change of behaviour at $h=0$: the equilibrium state\njumps discontinuously from $m=m^\\star$ to $m=-m^\\star$.\n\n\n ![Phase diagram of a simple magnet in the $H$-$T$ plane.](Figs/isingpdH.png){width=70% fig-align=\"left\" #fig-isingpdH}\n\nThis is called a first order phase transition as opposed to the \"second\norder\" or continuous transition that occurs at $T_c$ in zero field. The\ndefinitions are:\n\n*First order transition:* magnetisation (or similar order parameter)\ndepends discontinuously on a field variable (such as $h$ or $T$).\n\n*Continuous transition:* Change of functional form, but no discontinuity\nin $m$; typically, however, $(\\partial m/\\partial T)_h$ (or similar) is\neither discontinuous, or diverges with an integrable singularity.\n\nIn this terminology, we can say that the phase diagram of the magnet in\nthe $H,T$ plane shows a line of first order phase transitions,\nterminating at a continuous transition, which is the critical point.\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Aside on Quantum Criticality\n\nIn some magnetic systems such as $CePd_2Si_2$, one can, by applying\npressure or altering the chemical composition, depress the critical\ntemperature all the way to abolute zero! This may seem counterintuitive,\nafter all at $T=0$ one should expect perfect ordering, not the large\nfluctuations that accompany criticality. It turns out that the source of\nthe fluctuations that drive the system critical is zero point motion\nassociated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Quantum\ncriticality is a matter of ongoing active research, and open questions\nconcern the nature of the phase diagrams and the relationship to\nsuperconductivity. Although the subject goes beyond the scope of this\ncourse, there is an accessible article [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4628) if\nyou want to learn more.\n\n:::\n\n## A closer look: critical exponents\n\nLet us now see how we can calculate critical exponents within the mean\nfield approximation.\n\n### Zero H solution and the order parameter exponent\n\nIn zero field\n\n$$m=\\tanh(\\frac{mT_c}{T})$$ where $T_c=qJ/k_B$ is the critical\ntemperature at which $m$ first goes to zero.\n\nWe look for a solution where $m$ is small ($\\ll 1$). Expanding the tanh\nfunction and replacing $\\beta=(k_BT)^{-1}$ yields\n\n$$m=\\frac{mT_c}{T}-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{mT_c}{T} \\right)^3 +O(m^5)\\:.$$\nThen $m=0$ is one solution. The other solution is given by\n\n$$m^2=3\\left(\\frac{T}{T_c} \\right)^3\\left(\\frac{T_c}{T} -1\\right)$$\n\nNow, considering temperatures close to $T_c$ to guarantee small $m$, and\nemploying the reduced temperature $t=(T-T_c)/T_c$, one finds\n\n$$m^2\\simeq -3t$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nm= 0  &    ~~~\\textrm{for } T>T_c \\:\\:\\:  \\textrm{ since~otherwise~{\\it m}~imaginary}\\nonumber\\\\\nm= \\pm\\sqrt{-3t} & ~~\\textrm{ for}  \\:\\:\\: T<T_c ~~\\textrm{ real}\n\\end{aligned} $${#eq-mbeta}\nThis result implies that (within the mean field\napproximation) the critical exponent $\\beta=1/2$.\n\n### Finite (but small) field solution: the susceptibility exponent {#sec:closerlook}\n\nIn a finite, but small field we can expand @eq-mfmag thus:\n\n$$m=\\frac{mT_c}{T}-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{mT_c}{T} \\right)^3 +\\frac{H}{kT}$$\n\nConsider now the isothermal susceptibility\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\chi  \\equiv & \\left(\\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial H}\\right)_T\\\\\n      =     & \\frac{T_c}{T}\\chi - \\left(\\frac{T_c}{T}\\right)^3 \\chi m^2 + \\frac{1}{k_BT}  \n\\end{aligned}\n\nThen\n\n$$\\chi \\left[ 1-\\frac{T_c}{T} +\\left(\\frac{T_c}{T}\\right)^3m^2  \\right]=\\frac{1}{k_BT}$$\n\nHence near $T_c$\n\n$$\\chi=\\frac{1}{k_BT_c}\\left(\\frac{1}{t+m^2}\\right)$$\n\nThen using the results of @eq-mbeta\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\chi= (k_BT_ct)^{-1} & \\textrm{ for} ~~~ T> T_c \\\\\n\\chi= (-2k_BT_ct)^{-1} & \\textrm{ for}  ~~~T \\le T_c \n\\end{aligned} \nwhere one has to take the non-zero value for $m$ below\n$T_c$ to ensure +ve $\\chi$, i.e. thermodynamic stability. This result\nimplies that (within the mean field approximation) the critical exponent\n$\\gamma=1$.\n\nThe schematic behaviour of the Ising order parameter and susceptibility\nare shown in @fig-mfsum \n\n\n ![Mean field behaviour of the Ising magnetisation and susceptibility (schematic)](Figs/summary.png){width=80% fig-align=\"center\" #fig-mfsum}\n\n\n\n## Landau theory\n\nLandau theory is a slightly more general type of mean field theory than\nthat discussed in the previous subsection because it is not based on a\nparticular microscopic model. Its starting point is the Helmholtz free\nenergy, which Landau asserted can be written in terms of a truncated\npower series expansion of the order parameter. For a ferromagnet this\ntakes the form\n\n$$F(m)=F_0+a_2m^2+a_4m^4\n$${eq-landau}\n\nHere only the terms compatible with the order parameter symmetry are\nincluded in the expansion. On symmetry grounds, the free energy of a\nferromagnet should be invariant under a reversal of the sign of the\nmagnetisation. Terms linear and cubic in $m$ are not invariant under\n$m\\to -m$, and so do not feature.\n\nOne can understand how the Landau free energy can give rise to a\ncritical point by plotting its form for various values of $a_2$ with\n$a_4$ assumed positive (which ensures that the magnetisation remains\nbounded). This is shown in @fig-landau .\n\n\n ![Form of the Landau Free energy for a selection of values of the $a$ parameter.](Figs/landau.png){width=80% fig-align=\"center\" #fig-landau}\n\n\nThe situation is qualitatively similar to that discussed in @sec-breaking.\nThermodynamics tells us that the system adopts the state of lowest free\nenergy. Thus from @fig-landau, we see that for $a_2>0$, the system will have\n$m=0$, i.e. will be in the disordered (or paramagnetic) phase. For\n$a_2<0$, the minimum in the free energy occurs at a finite value of $m$,\nindicating that the ordered (ferromagnetic) phase is the stable one. In\nfact, the physical (up-down) spin symmetry built into $F$ indicates that\nthere are two equivalent stable states at $m=\\pm m^\\star$. $a_2=0$\ncorresponds to the critical point which marks the border between the\nordered and disordered phases.\n\nClearly $a_2$ controls the deviation from the critical temperature, and\naccordingly we may write\n\n$$a_2=\\tilde{a_2} t$$ where $t$ is the reduced temperature.\n\nWe can now attempt to calculate critical exponents. Restricting\nourselves first to the magnetisation exponent $\\beta$ defined by\n$m=t^\\beta$, we first find the equilibrium magnetisation, corresponding\nto the minimum of the Landau free energy:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dm}=2\\tilde{a_2} tm+4a_4m^3=0\n$${#eq-minimize}\n\nwhich implies\n\n$$m\\propto (-t)^{1/2},$$ so $\\beta=1/2$, which is again a mean field\nresult.\n\nLikewise we can calculate the effect of a small field $H$ if we sit at\nthe critical temperature $T_c$. Since $a_2=0$, we have\n\n$$F(m)=F_0+a_4m^4-Hm$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial m}=0 \\Rightarrow m(H,T_c)=\\left(\\frac{H}{4a_4}\\right)^{1/3}$$\n\nor\n\n$$H \\sim m^\\delta ~~~~~ \\delta=3$$ which defines a second\ncritical exponent.\n\nNote that at the critical point, a small applied field causes a very big\nincrease in magnetisation; formally, $(\\partial m/\\partial H)_T$ is\ninfinite at $T=T_c$.\n\nA third critical exponent can be defined from the magnetic\nsusceptibility at zero field\n\n$$\\chi=\\left(\\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial H}\\right)_{T,V} \\sim |T-T_c|^{-\\gamma}$$\n\n*Exercise*: Show that the Landau expansion predicts $\\gamma=1$.\n\nFinally we define a fourth critical exponent via the variation of the\nheat capacity (per site or per unit volume) $C_H$, in fixed external\nfield $H=0$:\n\n$$C_H \\sim |T-T_c|^{-\\alpha}$$\n\nBy convention, $\\alpha$ is defined to be positive for systems where\nthere is a *divergence* of the heat capacity at the critical point (very\noften the case). The heat capacity can be calculated from\n\n$$C_H =-T\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial T^2}$$\n\nFrom the minimization over $m$ @#eq-minimize one finds (*exercise*: check this)\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nF = & 0 ~~~~T>T_c\\nonumber\\\\\nF = & -a_2^2/4a_4 ~~~~ T < T_c\n\\end{aligned} \nUsing the fact that $a_2$ varies linearly with $T$, we have\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_H =& 0 ~~~~ T\\to T_c^+\\nonumber\\\\\nC_H =& \\frac{T\\tilde a_2^2}{2a_4} ~~~~ T \\to T_c^-\\:,\n\\end{aligned} \nwhich is actually a step discontinuity in specific heat.\nSince for positive $\\alpha$ the heat capacity is divergent, and for\nnegative $\\alpha$ it is continuous, this behaviour formally corresponds\nto $\\alpha=0$\n\n## Shortcomings of mean field theory\n\nWhile mean field theories provide a useful route to understanding\nqualitatively the phenomenology of phase transitions, in real\nferromagnets, as well as in more sophisticated theories, the critical\nexponents are not the simple fraction and integers found here. This\nfailure of mean field theory to predict the correct exponents is of\ncourse traceable to their neglect of correlations. In later sections we\nshall start to take the first steps to including the effects of long\nrange correlations.\n\n:::: center\n::: {#tab-exponents}\n  -----------------------------------
