Ordered phases of matter are typically characterised by spatial correlations, which can be **positional** or **orientational** in nature. 

Positional order is the regular arrangement of particle positions in space, often forming a repeating lattice structure. Orientational order refers to the angular alignment of the neighbours of a particle, influenced for example by the anisotropy of the particle itself (e.g. rods tending to align with other rods).

In crystalline phases, both positional and orientational order are long-ranged, meaning that the arrangement and orientation of particles are correlated over macroscopic distances. In contrast, simple liquids exhibit only very short-range (positional and orientational) correlations. 

Liquid crystals represent an intermediate case, where orientational order can persist over long distances while positional order remains short-ranged or absent.

## Anistropic particles

To favour a decoupling between orientational and positional degrees of freedom it is useful to work with anisotropic particles. Anisotropic particles have shapes that are not spherically symmetric, such as rods, ellipsoids, or plates. Their interactions depend not only on the distance between particles but also on their relative orientations. This anisotropy leads to rich phase behaviour, as we will see below.

## Orientational correlations and the isotropic/nematic transition


### Lattice model: the Lebwohl-Lasher model

The Lebwohl-Lasher model is a lattice model designed to capture the orientational ordering of anisotropic particles, such as those found in nematic liquid crystals and is a lattice version of the Maier-Saupe mean field model. In this model, each lattice site $i$ is associated with a unit vector $\mathbf{n}_i$ representing the local orientation (the "director") of a particle at that site.

The Hamiltonian of the Lebwohl-Lasher model is given by:

$$
H = -\epsilon \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} \left[ \frac{3}{2} (\mathbf{n}_i \cdot \mathbf{n}_j)^2 - \frac{1}{2} \right]
$$

where:
- $\epsilon > 0$ is the coupling constant favoring alignment,
- the sum $\langle i, j \rangle$ runs over all pairs of nearest-neighbor sites,
- $(\mathbf{n}_i \cdot \mathbf{n}_j)^2$ measures the degree of alignment between neighboring directors.

This Hamiltonian favors parallel (or antiparallel) alignment of neighboring directors, capturing the essential physics of the isotropic-nematic transition in liquid crystals.

In two dimensions, the Lebwohl-Lasher model is similarly defined, but the directors $\mathbf{n}_i$ are restricted to lie in the plane. Each director can be represented by a unit vector $\mathbf{n}_i = (\cos\theta_i, \sin\theta_i)$, where $\theta_i$ is the orientation angle at site $i$.

The Hamiltonian in 2D becomes:

$$
H = -\epsilon \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} \left[ \frac{3}{2} \cos^2(\theta_i - \theta_j) - \frac{1}{2} \right]
$$

where the sum is over nearest-neighbor pairs on a 2D lattice. This model captures the essential features of orientational ordering and the isotropic-nematic transition in two-dimensional systems.

## Activity

Modify the script above to check the following 

1.  The high temperature regime ($T\gg 0.5$$) is mostly disordered (isotropic)
2.  The low temperature regime forms larger and larger patches with coherent orientations
3. Define and plot a global nematic order parameter. Î¤he global nematic order parameter S is defined as:

$$ S = \langle \cos(2(\theta - \psi))\rangle$$ where $\psi$ is the director (average orientation), which in 2D is

$$\psi = \dfrac{1}{2} {\rm atan2}(\langle \sin(2\theta)\rangle, \langle \cos(2\theta)\rangle)$$
