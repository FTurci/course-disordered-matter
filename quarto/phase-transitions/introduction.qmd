# 1. Introduction to phase behaviour


A wide variety of physical systems undergo rearrangements of their
internal constituents in response to the thermodynamic conditions to
which they are subject. Two classic examples of systems displaying such
phase transitions are the ferromagnet and fluid systems. As the
temperature of a ferromagnet is increased, its magnetic moment is
observed to decrease smoothly, until at a certain temperature known as
the critical temperature, it vanishes altogether.

Similarly, a change of state from liquid to gas can be induced in a
fluid system (though not in an ideal gas) simply by raising the
temperature. Typically the liquid-vapour transition is abrupt,
reflecting the large density difference between the states either side
of the transition. However the abruptness of this transition can be
reduced by applying pressure. At one particular pressure and temperature
the discontinuity in the density difference between the two states
vanishes. These conditions of pressure and temperature serve to locate
the critical point for the fluid.

In the vicinity of a critical point, a system displays a host of remarkable behaviors known as *critical phenomena*. Chief among these is the divergence of thermal response functions—such as specific heat, compressibility, or magnetic susceptibility—which signal an enhanced sensitivity to external perturbations. These singularities arise from the emergence of large-scale cooperative interactions among the system’s microscopic constituents, leading to a diverging correlation length. One visually striking manifestation of this is *critical opalescence*, particularly observed in fluids like CO$_2$. As carbon dioxide nears its critical temperature and pressure, the distinction between its liquid and gas phases vanishes, giving rise to huge fluctuations in density. These fluctuations scatter visible light, rendering the fluid milky or opalescent. This scattering effect directly reflects the long-range correlations developing within the fluid. The movie below illustrates the effect as the critical temperature of CO$_2$ is approached from above.

The recalcitrant problem posed by the critical region is how best to
incorporate such collective effects within the framework of a rigorous
mathematical theory that affords both physical insight and quantitative
explanation of the observed phenomena. This matter has been (and still
is!) the subject of intense theoretical activity.

The importance of the critical point stems largely from the fact that
many of the phenomena observed in its vicinity are believed to be common
to a whole range of apparently quite disparate physical systems. Systems
such as liquid mixtures, superconductors, liquid crystals, ferromagnets,
antiferromagnets and molecular crystals may display identical behaviour
near criticality. This observation implies a profound underlying
similarity among physical systems at criticality, regardless of many
aspects of their distinctive microscopic nature. These ideas have found
formal expression in the so-called 'universality hypothesis' which,
since its inception some 35 years ago, has enjoyed considerable success.

In the next few lectures, principal aspects of the contemporary theoretical
viewpoint of phase transitions and critical phenomena will be reviewed.
Mean field theories of phase transitions will be discussed and their
inadequacies in the critical region will be exposed. The phenomenology
of the critical region will we described including power laws, critical
exponents and their relationship to scaling phenomena. These will be set
within the context of the powerful renormalisation group technique. The
notion of universality as a phenomenological hypothesis will be
introduced and its implications for real and model systems will be
explored. Finally, the utility of finite-size scaling methods for
computer studies of critical phenomena will be discussed, culminating in
the introduction of a specific technique suitable for exposing
universality in model systems.
