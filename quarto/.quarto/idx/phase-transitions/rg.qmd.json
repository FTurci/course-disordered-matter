Such a profusion of degrees of freedom can only be accurately\ncharacterized by a very large number of variables. Mean field theories\nand approximation schemes fail in the critical region because they at\nbest incorporate interactions among only a few spins, while neglecting\ncorrelations over larger distances. Similarly, the scaling hypothesis\nfails to provide more than a qualitative insight into the nature of\ncriticality because it focuses on only one length-scale, namely the\ncorrelation length itself. Evidently a fuller understanding of the\ncritical region may only be attained by taking account of the existence\nof structure on all length-scales. Such a scheme is provided by the\nrenormalisation group method, which stands today as the cornerstone of\nthe modern theory of critical phenomena.\n\n## The critical point: A many length scale problem\n\nA near critical system can be characterized by three important length\nscales, namely\n\n1.  The correlation length, $\\xi$, ie the size of correlated\n    microstructure.\n\n2.  Minimum length scale $L_\\textrm{ min}$, i.e. the smallest length in the\n    microscopics of the problem, e.g. lattice spacing of a magnet or the\n    particle size in a fluid.\n\n3.  Macroscopic size $L_{max}$ eg. size of the system.\n\nThe authentic critical region is defined by a window condition:\n\n$$L_\\textrm{ max} \\gg \\xi \\gg L_\\textrm{ min}$$\n\nThe physics of this regime is hard to tackle by analytic theory because\nit is characterized by configurational structure on all scales between\n$L_\\textrm{ min}$ and $\\xi$ (in fact it turns out that the near critical\nconfigurational patterns are *fractal*-like, cf.\nfig. [5](#fig:snapshots){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"fig:snapshots\"}(b)). Moreover different length scales are\ncorrelated with one another, giving rise to a profusion of coupled\nvariables in any theoretical description. The window regime is also not\neasily accessed by computer simulation because it entails studying very\nlarge system sizes $L_\\textrm{\nmax}$, often requiring considerable computing resources.\n\n## Methodology of the RG {#sec:rgmethod}\n\nThe central idea of the renormalisation group (RG) method is a stepwise\nelimination of the degrees of freedom of the system on successively\nlarger length-scales. To achieve this one introduces a fourth length\nscale $L$. In contrast to the other three, which characterize the system\nitself, $L$ characterises the *description* of the system. It may be\nthought of as typifying the size of the smallest resolvable detail in a\ndescription of the system's microstructure.\n\nConsider the Ising model arrangements displayed in\nfig. [5](#fig:snapshots){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"fig:snapshots\"}(a)-(c). These pictures contain *all* the\ndetails of each configuration shown: the resolution length $L$ in this\ncase has its smallest possible value, coinciding with the lattice\nspacing i.e. $L=L_{\\min}$. In the present context, the most detailed\ndescription is not the most useful: the essential signals with which we\nare concerned are hidden in a noise of relevant detail. A clue to\neliminating this noise lies in the nature of the correlation length,\ni.e. the size of the largest droplets. The explicit form of the small\nscale microstructure is irrelevant to the behaviour of $\\xi$. The small\nscale microstructure is the noise. To eliminate it, we simply select a\nlarger value of the resolution length (or 'coarse-graining' length) $L$.\n\nThere are many ways of implementing this coarse-graining procedure. We\nadopt a simple strategy in which we divide our sample into blocks of\nside $L$, each of which contains $L^d$ sites, with $d$ the space\ndimensions . The centres of the blocks define a lattice of points\nindexed by $I=1,2,....,N/L^d$. We associate with each block lattice\npoint centre, $I$, a coarse-grained or block variable $S_I(L)$ defined\nas the spatial average of the local variables it contains:\n\n$$S_I(L)=L^{-d}\\sum_i^Is_i\n\\label{eq:blkvar}$$ where the sum extends over the $L^d$ sites in the\nblock $I$. The set of coarse grained coordinates $\\{S(L)\\}$ are the\nbasic ingredients of a picture of the system having spatial resolution\nof order $L$.\n\nThe coarse graining operation is easily implemented on a computer. In so\ndoing one is faced with the fact that while the underlying Ising spins\ncan only take two possible values, the block variables $S_I(L)$ have\n$L^d+1$ possible values. Accordingly in displaying the consequences of\nthe blocking procedure, we need a more elaborate colour convention than\nthat used in fig. [5](#fig:snapshots){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"fig:snapshots\"}. We will associate with each block a shade of\ngrey drawn from a spectrum ranging from black to white.\n\n![See text for details](Figs/coarseconf1.jpg){#fig:c1 width=80%}\n\nThe results of coarse-graining configurations typical of three different\ntemperatures are shown in fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"fig:c1\"} and fig. [16](#fig:c2){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"fig:c2\"}. Two auxiliary operations are implicit in these\nresults. The first operation is a *length scaling*: the lattice spacing\non each blocked lattice has been scaled to the same size as that of the\noriginal lattice, making possible the display of correspondingly larger\nportions of the physical system. The second operation is a *variable\nscaling*: loosely speaking, we have adjusted the scale ('contrast') of\nthe block variable so as to match the spectrum of block variable values\nto the spectrum of shades at our disposal.\n\nConsider first a system marginally above its critical point at a\ntemperature $T$ chosen so that the correlation length $\\xi$ is\napproximately 6 lattice spacing units. A typical arrangement (without\ncoarse-graining) is shown in fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"fig:c1\"}(ai). The succeeding figures,\n [15](#fig:c1){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:c1\"}(aii) and\n [15](#fig:c1){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:c1\"}(aiii), show the\nresult of coarse-graining with block sizes $L=4$ and $L=8$,\nrespectively. A clear trend is apparent. The coarse-graining *amplifies*\nthe consequences of the small deviation of $T$ from $T_c$. As $L$ is\nincreased, the ratio of the size of the largest configurational features\n($\\xi$) to the size of the smallest ($L$) is reduced. The ratio $\\xi/L$\nprovides a natural measure of how 'critical' is a configuration. Thus\nthe coarse-graining operation generates a representation of the system\nthat is effectively less critical the larger the coarse-graining length.\nThe limit point of this trend is the effectively fully disordered\narrangement shown in fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"fig:c1\"}(aiii) and in an alternative form in\nfig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:c1\"}(aiv), which\nshows the limiting distribution of the coarse grained variables,\naveraged over many realizations of the underlying configurations: the\ndistribution is a Gaussian which is narrow (even more so the larger the\n$L$ value) and centred on zero. This limit is easily understood. When\nthe system is viewed on a scaled $L$ larger than $\\xi$, the correlated\nmicrostructure is no longer explicitly apparent; each coarse-grained\nvariable is essentially independent of the others.\n\nA similar trend is apparent below the critical point.\nFig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:c1\"}(bi) show a\ntypical arrangement at a temperature $T<T_c$ such that again $\\xi$ is\napproximately $6$ lattice spacings. Coarse-graining with $L=4$ and $L=8$\nagain generates representations which are effectively less critical\n(figs. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:c1\"}(bii) and\n(biii)). This time the coarse-graining smoothes out the microstructure\nwhich makes the order incomplete. The limit point of this procedure is a\nhomogeneously ordered arrangement in which the block variables have a\nrandom (Gaussian) distribution centred on the order parameter\n(fig. [15](#fig:c1){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:c1\"}(biv)).\n\nConsider now the situation *at* the critical point.\nFig. [16](#fig:c2){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:c2\"}(ai) shows a\ntypical arrangement; figs.  [16](#fig:c2){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"fig:c2\"}(aii) and (aiii) show the results of coarse-graining\nwith $L=4$ and $L=8$ respectively. Since the $\\xi$ is as large as the\nsystem itself the coarse graining does not produce less critical\nrepresentations of the physical system: each of the figures displays\nstructure over *all* length scales between the lower limit set by $L$\nand the upper limit set by the size of the display itself. A limiting\ntrend is nevertheless apparent. Although the $L=4$ pattern is\nqualitatively quite different from the pattern of the local variables,\nthe $L=4$ and $L=8$ patterns display qualitatively similar features.\nThese similarities are more profound than is immediately apparent. A\nstatistical analysis of the spectrum of $L=4$ configurations (generated\nas the local variables evolve in time) show that it is almost identical\nto that of the $L=8$ configurations (given the block variable scaling).\nThe implication of this limiting behaviour is clear: the patterns formed\nby the ordering variable at criticality look the same (in a statistical\nsense) when viewed on all sufficiently large length scales.\n\n![See text for details](Figs/coarseconf2.png){#fig:c2 width=80%}\n\nLet us summarize. Under the coarse-graining operation there is an\nevolution or *flow* of the system's configuration spectrum. The flow\ntends to a limit, or fixed point, such that the pattern spectrum does\nnot change under further coarse-graining. These scale-invariant limits\nhave a trivial character for $T>T_c$, (a perfectly disordered\narrangement) and $T\n< T_c$, (a perfectly ordered arrangement). The hallmark of the critical\npoint is the existence of a scale-invariant limit which is neither fully\nordered nor fully disordered but which possesses structure on all length\nscales.\n\n## Universality and Scaling\n\nEquipped with the coarse-graining technique, we now address the\nuniversality phenomenon. We aim to understand how it is that systems\nthat are different microscopically can nevertheless display critical\npoint behaviour which (in certain respects) is quantitatively identical.\n\nTo obtain initial insight we introduce a spin-1 Ising model in which the\nspins take on three values ($s_i=1,0,-1$), in contrast to the two values\n($s_i=1,-1$) of the spin-1/2 Ising model. The two models have properties\nwhich are different: for example, $T_c$ for the three-state model is\nsome $30\\%$ lower than that of the two-state model (for the same\ncoupling $J$). However, there is abundant evidence that the two models\nhave the same universal properties.\n\nLet us explore what is the same and what is different in the\nconfigurations of the two models at criticality. The configurations of\nthe local variables $s_i$ are clearly qualitatively different for the\ntwo models. Now consider the coarse-grained configurations (with $L=4$\nand $L=8$ respectively) for the three-state model at the critical point.\nWe have already seen that the coarse-graining operation bears the\nconfiguration spectrum of the critical two-state Ising model to a\nnon-trivial scale-invariant limit. It is scarcely surprising that the\nsame is true for the three-state model. What is remarkable is that the\ntwo limits are the same! This is expressed in\nfig. [16](#fig:c2){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:c2\"}(iv), which\nshows the near coincidence of the distribution of block variables\n(grey-levels) for the two different coarse-graining lengths. Thus the\ncoarse-graining erases the physical differences apparent in\nconfigurations where the local behaviour is resolvable, and exposes a\nprofound configurational similarity.\n\n### Fluid-magnet universality\n\nLet us now turn to fluid-magnet universality. In a magnet, the relevant\nconfigurations are those formed by the coarse-grained magnetisation (the\nmagnetic moment averaged over a block of side $L$). In a fluid, the\nrelevant configurations are those of the coarse-grained density (the\nmass averaged over a block if side $L$) or more precisely, its\nfluctuation from its macroscopic average\n(Fig. [17](#fig:fmcoarse){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"fig:fmcoarse\"}). The patterns in the latter (bubbles of\nliquid or vapour) may be matched to pattern in the former (microdomains\nof the magnetisation), given appropriate scaling operations to\ncamouflage the differences between the length scales and the differences\nbetween the variable scales.\n\n![Schematic representation of the coarse graining operation via which the universal properties of fluids and magnets may be exposed.](Figs/coarse.png){#fig:fmcoarse width=50%}\n\nThe results is illustrated in\nFig. [18](#fig:confscomp){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"fig:confscomp\"}. For the full demonstration the YouTube video\nat\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd4UvhUsBAU.\n\n::: {#fig-confscomp layout-ncol=2}\n![2D critical Ising model](Figs/fluid-magnet.png){}\n\n![2D critical Lennard-Jones fluid](Figs/fluid-magnet2.png){}\n\n\nSnapshot configurations of the 2D critical Ising model\n(left) and the 2D critical Lennard-Jones fluid (right). When viewed on\nsufficiently large length scales the configurational patterns appear\nuniversal and self similar.\n:::\n\n## Near critical scaling\n\nThe similarity of coarse-grained configurations of different systems is\nnot restricted to the critical temperature itself. Suppose we have a two\nstate spin model and a three state spin model each somewhat above their\ncritical points at reduced temperature $t$. The two systems will have\nsomewhat different correlation lengths, $\\xi_1$ and $\\xi_2$ say. Suppose\nhowever, we choose coarse-graining lengths $L_1$ for $L_2$ for the two\nmodels such that $\\xi_1/L_1=\\xi_2/L_2$. We adjust the scales of the\nblock variables (our grey level control) so that the typical variable\nvalue is the same for the two systems. We adjust the length scale of the\nsystems (stretch or shrink our snapshots) so that the sizes of the\nminimum-length-scale structure (set by $L_1$ and $L_2$) looks the same\nfor each system. Precisely what they look like depends upon our choice\nof $\\xi/L$.\n\n## Universality classes {#sec:unipics}\n\nCoarse graining does not erase all differences between the physical\nproperties of critical systems. Differences in the space dimension $d$\nof two critical systems will lead to different universal properties such\nas critical exponents. Thus, for instance, the critical exponents of the\n2D magnet, match those of the 2d fluid, but they are different to those\nof 3d magnets and fluids.\n\nIn fact the space dimension is one of a small set of qualitative\nfeatures of a critical system which are sufficiently deep-seated to\nsurvive coarse graining and which together serve to define the system's\nuniversal behaviour, or *universality class*. The constituents of this\nset are not all identifiable *a priori*. They include the number of\ncomponents $n$ of the order parameter. Up to now, we have only\nconsidered order parameters which are scalar (for a fluid the density,\nfor a magnet the magnetisation), for which $n=1$. In some ferromagnets,\nthe order parameter may have components along two axes, or three axes,\nimplying a vector order parameter, with $n=2$ or $n=3$, respectively. It\nis clear that the order-parameter $n$-value will be reflected in the\nnature of the coarse-grained configurations, and thus in the universal\nobservables they imply.\n\nA third important feature which can change the universality class of a\ncritical system is the range of the interaction potential between its\nconstituent particles. Clearly for the Ising model, interactions between\nspins are inherently nearest neighbour in character. Most fluids\ninteract via dispersion forces (such as the Lennard-Jones potential)\nwhich is also short ranged owing to the $r^{-6}$ attractive interaction.\nHowever some systems have much longer ranged interactions. Notable here\nare systems of charged particles which interact via a Coulomb potential.\nThe long ranged nature of the Coulomb potential (which decays like\n$r^{-1}$) means that charged systems often do not have the same critical\nexponents as the Ising model and fluid.\n\n## Critical exponents\n\nWe consider now how the critical exponents, may be computed via the\ncoarse-graining procedure. In what follows we will refer only to the\nbehaviour of a single typical coarse grained variable, which we shall\ndenote $S(L)$. We suppose that $t$ is sufficiently small that $\\xi \\gg\nL_\\textrm{ min}$. Universality and scaling may be expressed in the claim\nthat, for *any* $L$ and $t$, scale factors $a(L)$ and $b(L)$ may be\nfound such that the probability distribution $p(S(L),t)$ can be written\nin the form\n\n$$p(S(L),t)=b(L)\\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)\n\\label{eq:blocks}$$ where $\\tilde{p}$ is a function unique to a\nuniversality class. The role of the scale factors $a$ and $b$ is to\nabsorb the basic non-universal scales identified in\nsec. [9.2](#sec:rgmethod){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"sec:rgmethod\"}. The critical exponents are implicit in the\n$L$-dependence of these scale factors. Specifically one finds:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\na(L)&=&a_0L^{1/\\nu} \\\\\nb(L)&=&b_0L^{\\beta/\\nu}\n\\label{eq:scalefacs}\n\\end{aligned} where the amplitudes $a_0$ and $b_0$ are system specific\n(non-universal) constants.\n\nThese results state that the critical exponents (in the form $1/\\nu$ and\n$\\beta/\\nu$) characterize the ways in which the configuration spectrum\nevolves under coarse-graining. Consider, first the exponent ratio\n$\\beta/\\nu$. Precisely at the critical point, there is only one way in\nwhich the coarse-grained configurations change with $L$: the overall\nscale of the coarse-grained variable (the black-white contrast in our\ngrey scale representation) is eroded with increasing $L$. Thus the\nconfigurations of coarse-graining length $L_1$ match those of a larger\ncoarse-graining length $L_2$ only if the variable scale in the latter\nconfigurations is amplified. The required amplification follows from\neqns. [\\[eq:blocks\\]](#eq:blocks){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:blocks\"}\nand [\\[eq:scalefacs\\]](#eq:scalefacs){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:scalefacs\"}: it is\n\n$$\\frac{b(L_2)}{b(L_1)}=\\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_1}\\right)^{\\beta/\\nu}\\:.$$\nThe exponent ratio $\\beta/\\nu$ thus controls the rate at which the scale\nof the ordering variable decays with increasing coarse-graining length.\n\nConsider now the exponent $1/\\nu$. For small but non-zero reduced\ntemperature (large but finite $\\xi$) there is second way in which the\nconfiguration spectrum evolves with $L$. As noted previously, coarse\ngraining reduces the ratio of correlation length to coarse-graining\nlength, and results in configurations with a less critical appearance.\nMore precisely, we see from\neq. [\\[eq:blocks\\]](#eq:blocks){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:blocks\"} that increasing the coarse graining length from\n$L_1$ to $L_2$ while keeping the reduced temperature constant has the\nsame effect on the configuration spectrum as keeping coarse-graining\nlength constant which amplifying the reduced temperature $t$ by a factor\n\n$$\\frac{a(L_2)}{a(L_1)}=\\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_1}\\right)^{1/\\nu}\\:.$$ One\nmay think of the combination $a(L)t$ as a measure of the effective\nreduced temperature of the physical system viewed with resolution length\n$L$. The exponent $1/\\nu$ controls the rate at which the effective\nreduced temperature flows with increasing coarse-graining length.\n\n## Finite-size scaling {#sec-fss}\n\nWe can exploit the fact that the scale factors $a(L)$ and $b(L)$ depend\non critical exponents to estimate the values of these exponents using\ncomputer simulation. Consider the average of the block variable $S(L)$.\nConsideration of eq. [\\[eq:blkvar\\]](#eq:blkvar){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:blkvar\"} shows that this is non other than the value of\nthe order parameter $Q$, measured over a block of side $L$. Thus from\nthe definition of an average\n\n$$Q(L,t)=\\bar {S}(L,t)=\\int S(L)p(S(L),t)dS(L)$$ where $p(S(L))$ is the\nprobability distribution of $S(L)$.\n\nMaking use of the representation of\neq. [\\[eq:blocks\\]](#eq:blocks){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"eq:blocks\"}, we then have that\n\n$$Q(L,t) = \\int b(L)S(L)\\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)dS(L)$$\n\nTo integrate this we need to change the integration variable from $S(L)$\nto $b(L)S(L)$. We have $d(b(L)S(L))=b(L)dS(L)$ since $b(L)$ does not\nfluctuate. Thus\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ(L,t) =& b^{-1}(L)\\int b(L)S(L)\\tilde{p}(b(L)S(L),a(L)t)d(b(L)S(L))\\nonumber\\\\\n       =& b^{-1}(L)f(a(L)t)\\nonumber\\\\\n       =& b_0L^{-\\beta/\\nu}f(a_0L^{1/\\nu}t)\n\\end{aligned} where $f$ is a universal function (defined as the first\nmoment of $\\tilde{p}(x,y)$ with respect to $y$).\n\nThe above results provide a method for determining the critical exponent\nratios $\\beta/\\nu$ and $1/\\nu$ via computer simulations of near critical\nsystems. For instance, at the critical point ($t=0$) and for finite\nblock size, $Q(L,0)$ will not be zero (the $T$ at which Q vanishes for\nfinite $L$ is above the true $T_c$, cf.\nsec [8.2](#sec:compsim){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:compsim\"}).\nHowever, we know that its value must vanish in the limit of infinite\n$L$; it does so like\n\n$$Q(L,0)=b_0L^{-\\beta/\\nu}f(0)\\equiv Q_0L^{-\\beta/\\nu}$$\n\nThus by studying the critical point $L$ dependence of $Q$ we can\nestimate $\\beta/\\nu$. A similar approach in which we study two block\nsizes $L$, and tune $t$ separately in each case so that the results for\n$QL^{\\beta/\\nu}$ are identical provides information on the value of\n$1/\\nu$.\n\n\n## Summary of main points\nAs this is quite a long chapter let us summarise the main points: \n\n\n- **Limitations of conventional theories**: Mean field theories and the scaling hypothesis are insufficient in the critical region due to their neglect of correlations across all relevant length scales.\n\n- **Critical region characteristics**: Near-critical systems exhibit correlated microstructure on all length scales up to the correlation length. The complexity of this structure makes both analytical and computational study challenging.\n\n- **Relevant length scales**:\n  1. Correlation length ($\\xi$)\n  2. Minimum microscopic scale ($L_\\textrm{min}$)\n  3. Macroscopic system size ($L_\\textrm{max}$)\n\n- **Window Condition for criticality**: The true critical regime satisfies $L_\\textrm{max} \\gg \\xi \\gg L_\\textrm{min}$, encompassing a broad range of scales where complex, often fractal-like, structures are present.\n\n- **Renormalisation Group (RG) methodology**: RG involves the stepwise elimination of degrees of freedom by coarse-graining the system over increasing length scales. A fourth scale, $L$, represents the resolution at which the system is described.\n\n- **Effect of coarse-graining**: Coarse-graining changes the effective reduced temperature, captured by the relation $a(L)t$, where $a(L)$ scales with $L$ as $L^{1/\\nu}$. This helps describe how critical configurations evolve with resolution.\n\n- **Universality**:\n  - Coarse-graining reveals that microscopically different systems can exhibit identical critical behavior when observed at large scales.\n  - The concept of **universality** explains why disparate systems, such as magnets and fluids, can show the same critical exponents and scaling laws.\n  - Critical behavior depends primarily on general features like dimensionality and symmetry, rather than microscopic details.\n\n\n- **Finite-Size scaling**:\n  - The average block variable $Q(L,t)$ is related to block size $L$ and reduced temperature $t$ through scaling relations. Computer simulations exploit this to extract scaling functions and the values of critical exponents. \n
