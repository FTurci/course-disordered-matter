If the lattice spacing is $a$, we define the step statistics as:\n\n$$\n\\Delta x(t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n+a & \\text{with probability } \\nu \\Delta t \\\\\n-a & \\text{with probability } \\nu \\Delta t \\\\\n0 & \\text{with probability } 1 - 2\\nu \\Delta t\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThis defines a discrete-time, discrete-space random walk. The average and variance of the step are:\n\n* Mean: $\\langle \\Delta x \\rangle = 0$\n\n* Variance: $\\langle (\\Delta x)^2 \\rangle = 2 a^2 \\nu \\Delta t = 2D \\Delta t$\n\nThe steps $\\Delta x(t)$ are uncorrelated across time.\n\nTo take the continuum limit, we let both $a \\to 0$ and $\\Delta t \\to 0$ in such a way that:\n\n$$\na \\propto \\sqrt{\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nIn this limit, we obtain the **Langevin equation**:\n\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t) = \\eta(t)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta(t)$ is a stochastic force (noise) satisfying:\n\n$$\n\\langle \\eta(t) \\rangle = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n\\langle \\eta(t) \\eta(t') \\rangle = \\Gamma \\delta(t - t')\n$$\n\nThis $\\eta(t)$ is known as white noise — it has zero mean and is uncorrelated at different times.\n\nThe Langevin equation tells us that the velocity $\\dot{x}(t)$ is purely driven by noise. We can formally integrate it:\n\n$$\nx(t) - x_0 = \\int_0^t \\eta(t')\\, dt'\n$$\n\nTaking ensemble averages:\n\n* Mean displacement:\n  $$\n  \\langle x(t) - x_0 \\rangle = 0\n  $$\n\n* Mean square displacement:\n  $$\n  \\langle [x(t) - x_0]^2 \\rangle = \\int_0^t \\int_0^t \\langle \\eta(t') \\eta(t'') \\rangle\\, dt'\\, dt'' = \\Gamma \\int_0^t dt' = \\Gamma t\n  $$\n\nComparing this with the diffusion equation result, we identify:\n\n$$\n\\Gamma = 2D\n$$\n\nHence, the Langevin description yields the same physical behavior — not just the mean-square displacement but also the full probability distribution $p(x, t)$ — as the diffusion (Fokker-Planck) equation. This equivalence arises from the fact that the integral of many small, independent random steps leads to a Gaussian distribution, in agreement with the solution of the diffusion equation.\n\nFor more details, see: *Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry* by N.G. van Kampen (North Holland, 1981).\n\n## Brownian Motion\n\nLet us now examine Brownian motion, originally observed as the erratic motion of colloidal particles suspended in a fluid. These particles undergo constant collisions with surrounding (smaller) fluid molecules, which results in seemingly random movement.\n\nFrom a coarse-grained perspective — where we do not track each individual collision — this appears as motion under random forces. This statistical treatment introduces irreversibility at the macroscopic level, even though the underlying molecular dynamics are reversible.\n\nThe Langevin equation provides a way to model this behavior. For a particle of mass $m$ in one dimension, Langevin proposed the equation:\n\n$$\nm \\ddot{x} = -\\gamma \\dot{x} + f(t)\n$$\n\nHere:\n\n* $-\\gamma \\dot{x}$ is a frictional damping force, where $\\gamma$ is the damping coefficient.\n* $f(t)$ is a random force due to molecular collisions.\n\n> Often, the mobility is defined as $\\mu = 1/\\gamma$ — note that this is unrelated to chemical potential.\n\n---\n\n### Noise Properties\n\n\n\nIn principle the random forces are \\textit{correlated} in time since the molecular collisions which cause them are correlated and have some definite duration. \n\n\nLet us assume that there is some correlation time $t_c$ over which $\\langle f(t_1) f(t_2) \\rangle = g(t_1 - t_2)$ decays rapidly as shown in the sketch:\n\n![Sketch of $g(t1− t2)$ against $|t1− t2|$](Figs/autocorrelate.png){#fig-autocorrelate\nwidth=60%} \n\nThen as long as we consider timescales $\\gg t_c$ we can safely replace $g(t_1 - t_2)$ by a delta function. Thus  we can approximate the noise by\n\n$$\n\\langle f(t) \\rangle = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n\\langle f(t_1) f(t_2) \\rangle = \\Gamma \\delta(t_1 - t_2)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Solving the Langevin Equation (Velocity)\n\nLet’s set $m = 1$ for simplicity and solve the equation:\n\n$$\n\\dot{v} + \\gamma v = f(t)\n$$\n\nWe apply an integrating factor:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ v e^{\\gamma t} \\right] = e^{\\gamma t} f(t)\n$$\n\nIntegrating both sides:\n\n$$\nv(t) = v_0 e^{-\\gamma t} + \\int_0^t e^{-\\gamma (t - t')} f(t')\\, dt'\n$$\n\nTaking the average:\n\n$$\n\\langle v(t) \\rangle = v_0 e^{-\\gamma t}\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n* At short times: ($\\gamma t \\ll 1$): $\\langle v \\rangle \\approx v_0$ ie. friction is negligible.\n* At long times: ($\\gamma t \\gg 1$): $\\langle v \\rangle \\to 0$ ie. the system loses memory of the initial velocity.\n\n---\n\n### Mean-Square Velocity\n\nWe now compute:\n\n$$\n\\langle v(t)^2 \\rangle = v_0^2 e^{-2\\gamma t} + \\Gamma \\int_0^t e^{-2\\gamma (t - t')} dt' = v_0^2 e^{-2\\gamma t} + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\gamma} \\left(1 - e^{-2\\gamma t} \\right)\n$$\n\nImplying that at\n\n* Short times: $\\langle v^2 \\rangle \\approx v_0^2$\n* Long times: $\\langle v^2 \\rangle \\to \\Gamma / (2\\gamma)$\n\nAt equilibrium, the equipartition theorem gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m \\langle v^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T\n$$\n\nUsing this to identify $\\Gamma$:\n\n$$\n\\Gamma = 2 \\gamma k_B T\n$$\n\nThis important result relates the noise strength to the damping and temperature — they have the same microscopic origin (molecular collisions).\n\n---\n\n### Mean-Square Displacement\n\nWe now integrate $v(t)$ again to get position $x(t)$ (with $m = 1$):\n\nUsing the result above and substituting $\\Gamma = 2\\gamma k_B T$, we find:\n\n$$\n\\langle [x(t) - x_0]^2 \\rangle = \\frac{(v_0^2 - k_B T)}{\\gamma^2} (1 - e^{-\\gamma t})^2 + \\frac{2 k_B T}{\\gamma} \\left[ t - \\frac{1 - e^{-\\gamma t}}{\\gamma} \\right]\n$$\n\nLimiting behaviors:\n\n* Short times: ($\\gamma t \\ll 1$):\n\n  $$\n  \\langle [x(t) - x_0]^2 \\rangle \\approx v_0^2 t^2\n  $$\n\n  (correspinding to *ballistic* motion)\n\n* Long time ($\\gamma t \\gg 1$): \n\n  $$\n  \\langle [x(t) - x_0]^2 \\rangle \\approx \\frac{2 k_B T}{\\gamma} t\n  $$\n\n  (corresponding to *diffusive motion*)\n\nThe effective diffusion constant is:\n\n$$\nD = \\frac{k_B T}{\\gamma}\n$$\n\nThis is the **Einstein relation**, connecting the rate of diffusion to temperature and damping.\n It is useful as it allows an explicit expression for the diffusion\nconstant if one knows $\\gamma$. A famous example is a sphere: the equation for fluid flow past a moving\nsphere may be solved and yields  $\\gamma=6\\pi\\eta a$ where $a$ is the radius of the sphere and here $\\eta$ is\nthe fluid viscosity. This gives\n\n$$\nD=\\frac{6\\pi\\eta a}{kT}\n$$\nwhich is the **Stokes-Einstein** formula for the diffusion constant of a colloidal particle.\n\n---\n\n### External Forces and Mobility\n\nNow consider a charged particle with charge $q$ under an external electric field $E$. The Langevin equation becomes:\n\n$$\nm \\dot{v} = -\\gamma v + qE\n$$\n\nAt long times, the particle reaches a steady drift velocity:\n\n$$\n\\langle v \\rangle = \\frac{qE}{\\gamma} = \\frac{qED}{k_B T}\n$$\n\nDefining the mobility $\\mu$ by $\\langle v \\rangle = \\mu qE$, we get the **Nernst-Einstein relation**:\n\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{D}{k_B T}\n$$\n\nThis relation connects the response of a system to an external perturbation (mobility) with its internal fluctuations (diffusivity).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"live-html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"live-html","base-format":"html","extension-name":"live"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["/Users/phxnw/Dropbox/course-disordered-matter/quarto/_extensions/r-wasm/live/live.lua"],"toc":true,"output-file":"Brownian-and-Langevin-dynamics.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
