<p>A polymer is a <strong>large molecule</strong> made up of many small, simple chemical units, joined together by chemical bonds. The basic unit of this sequence is called a <strong>monomer</strong>, and the number of units in the sequence is called the <strong>degree of polymerisation</strong>.</p>
<p>It is possible to have polymers containing over <span class="math inline">\(10^{5}\)</span> units and there are naturally occurring polymers with a degree of polymerisation exceeding <span class="math inline">\(10^{9}\)</span>. For example, polystyrene with a degree of polymerisation of <span class="math inline">\(10^{5}\)</span> has a molecular weight of about <span class="math inline">\(10^{7} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}\)</span> and, if fully stretched out, would be about 25 <span class="math inline">\(\mu \mathrm{m}\)</span> long.</p>
<p>Polymers play a central role in many fields, ranging from technology to biology. This is reflected in a huge number of different chemical structures. Given this manifold and the complexity of polymer molecules, the theories are astonishingly simple. This is possible because of the characteristic feature of polymers: The molecule itself is <strong>very large</strong> (compared to the individual units) and the macroscopic behaviour is dominated by this large-scale property of the molecule. Theories focus on such <em>large-scale</em> properties, whereas the small scale <em>fine structure</em> is typicaly resolved by computer simulations.</p>
<p>Polymers exist in very different architectures, such as</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>linear</strong>: straight chains of repeating units (e.g., polyethylene).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>branched</strong>: polymers with a main chain and side chains (branches) attached. The branching affects properties like density and melting point (e.g., low-density polyethylene).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>star</strong>: polymers with multiple linear chains (arms) radiating from a central core. These structures can have unique properties like lower viscosity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>cross-linked</strong>: polymers where chains are interconnected by covalent bonds, forming a network. This structure makes them rigid and heat-resistant (e.g., vulcanized rubber).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, a large variation in the chemical structure may be achieved by combining different monomers (<strong>copolymerisation</strong>).</p>
<p>For simplicity, we will focus on <strong>linear homopolymers</strong>, i.e.&nbsp;with no branch points and with all identical subunits.</p>

<p>In order to understand the properties of most substances, we must consider a large assembly of molecules. In the case of polymers, however, the molecules themselves are very large and due to their flexibility they can take up an enormous number of configurations by rotation of chemical bonds. The shape of the polymer can therefore only be usefully described <strong>statistically</strong> and one need to use statistical mechanics to calculate the characteristics of even an isolated polymer.</p>
<p>To be able to investigate the properties of a <strong>single polymer</strong> and to neglect interactions between polymers, the polymer is placed in a very <strong>dilute solution</strong>. In this chapter, we will theoretically investigate the properties of an isolated, single polymer chain in solution (which in addition is linear and consists of only one kind of monomers).</p>

<h3 data-number="15.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="freely-jointed-chain"><span class="header-section-number">15.2.1</span> Freely-jointed chain</h3>
<p>Many polymers are highly flexible and are coiled up in solution. In a simple model we thus describe a polymer with two assumptions :</p>
<ul>
<li>it is composed of a <strong>large number of segments</strong> freely joined up</li>
<li>all angles between segments are assumed to be <strong>equally likely</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The momomers are located at positions <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{j}}\)</span> and connected by bonds <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_{j}=\mathbf{R}_{j}-\mathbf{R}_{j-1}\)</span> of length <span class="math inline">\(\left|\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|=b_{0}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <strong>end-to-end vector</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span> is then simply the vector linking the head to the tail fo the chain:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{r}_1+\mathbf{r}_2+\dots+\mathbf{r}_N = \sum_{j=1}^N \mathbf{r}_j.\]</span></p>
<p>At any instant, the configuration (arrangement) of the polymer is one realisation of an N-step random walk in three dimensions.</p>

<p>In time, the various segments undergo Brownian motion and the polymer fluctuates between all possible configurations of the random walk. Rememebr however that it does this with fixed inter-monomer distance.</p>
<p>The mean squared end-to-end distance is then simply <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\langle\mathbf{R}^2\rangle &amp;= \left\langle \left( \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i\right) \cdot  \left( \sum_{j=1}^N \mathbf{r}_j\right) \right\rangle\\
&amp;= \left\langle \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N  \mathbf{r}_i \mathbf{r}_j \right\rangle\\
\end{aligned}\]</span> We can split the sum into the terms where <span class="math inline">\(i=j\)</span> and the rest. This yields in general</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\langle \mathbf{R}^2\rangle = Nb_0^2+\langle \mathbf{r}_i \mathbf{r}_j  \rangle\]</span></p>
<p>where the second term simply encodes the covariances between the (random) variables <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_i,\mathbf{r}_j\)</span>. Since we assumed (in this simplistic case) that they are independent, only the first term remains for the free-jointed chain</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\langle \mathbf{R}^2\rangle = Nb_0^2\]</span></p>
<p>This is essentially the same result as for the mean squared displacement of a random walk, provided that we recognise that the number of monomers has taken the role played by time inbthe case of the wal. We had <span class="math inline">\({\rm MSD}\propto t\)</span> and here we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\langle \mathbf{R}^2\rangle\propto N\]</span></p>
<p>Since we formally inherit all the results holding for a random walk, we can also predict what happens to the distribution of possible end-to-end distances in the limit of long polymers, i.e.&nbsp;large <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p>
<p>The mean squaerd end to end distance can be decomposed as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\left\langle\mathbf{R}^2\right\rangle=\left\langle R_x^2\right\rangle+\left\langle R_y^2\right\rangle+\left\langle R_z^2\right\rangle=3 \sigma^2=N b_0^2 \Rightarrow \sigma^2=\frac{N b_0^2}{3}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is the variance per component.</p>
<p>We know that the random walk converges to a Gaussian distribution in 3d with each component having variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. Thus, for large <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, the probability distribution for the end-to-end vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[
P(\mathbf{R}) = \left( \frac{3}{2\pi N b_0^2} \right)^{3/2} \exp\left( -\frac{3 \mathbf{R}^2}{2 N b_0^2} \right)
\]</span></p>
<p>This means that, for long chains, the end-to-end distance is distributed as a 3D Gaussian, centered at zero, with variance proportional to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Also, we can</p>

<section id="radius-of-gyration" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="radius-of-gyration">Radius of gyration</h4>
<p>While the end-to-end distance represents a well-defined quantity for a linear chain, we need a more versatile measure of the size for more complicated architectures, such as branched or star-shaped polymers. This is provided by the so called <strong>radius of gyration</strong>, a measure of the (average) extent of the polymer chain.</p>
<p>The radius of gyration is a generic quantity that can be measured from any point cloud. It is closely linked to the (co)-variance of the set of points.</p>
<p>We define the <strong>center of mass</strong> as the average position</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathbf{R}_{\rm CM}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \mathbf{R}_{j}\]</span></p>
<p>A general way to describe the spatial extent and shape of the polymer is to construct the <strong>gyration tensor</strong> (also called the configuration tensor):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N (\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_{\rm CM}) \otimes (\mathbf{R}_j - \mathbf{R}_{\rm CM})
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\otimes\)</span> denotes the outer product, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(3 \times 3\)</span> symmetric matrix. The elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span> are given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S_{\alpha\beta} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N (R_{j,\alpha} - R_{{\rm CM},\alpha})(R_{j,\beta} - R_{{\rm CM},\beta})
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \beta \in \{x, y, z\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <strong>radius of gyration squared</strong> is then simply the trace of this tensor:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
R_g^2 = \mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{S}) = S_{xx} + S_{yy} + S_{zz}
\]</span></p>
<p>The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span> provide information about the principal axes and shape anisotropy of the polymer coil. The <strong>tensor of gyration</strong> correspondss to the <strong>covariance matrix</strong> of the positions <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}_j\)</span>.</p>
<p>The radius of gyration is direcly proportional to the end-to-end vector.</p>

<p>The <strong>valence angle</strong> (also called the bond angle) is the angle formed between two adjacent chemical bonds originating from the same atom. In the context of polymers, it is the angle between two consecutive bonds along the polymer backbone. The value of the valence angle is determined by the chemical structure of the monomer and affects the flexibility and overall conformation of the polymer chain. For example, in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-butane, the C–C–C bond angle is about <span class="math inline">\(112^\circ\)</span>. Still rotations about the C-C bond are possible.</p>

<p>At low temperatures ( <span class="math inline">\(k_{B} T &lt; {\mathrm {\text{configurational energy}}}\)</span>) the configuration will thus be predominantly of type <strong>A</strong> (an anti conformation).

<p>This suggests that a good model of polymeric conformation can take fixed angles between bonds, but needs to include <strong>free rotation</strong> <em>about</em> the bonds. This model is called the <strong>freely-rotating chain</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="figs/freelyrotating.svg" class="img-fluid" width="250"></p>
</div>
<p>We start with a fixed configuration of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_{l}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_{2}, \ldots, \mathbf{r}_{j-1}\)</span> and then add the next segment <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_{j}\)</span>. While the bond angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is given by the chemistry of the molecule, the segment can still freely rotate about the axis defined by <span class="math inline">\(r_{j-1}\)</span>, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> can take any value <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq \varphi \leq 2 \pi\)</span>. If we average <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_{j}\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span>, while keeping <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_{1}, \mathbf{r}_{2}, \ldots, \mathbf{r}_{j-1}\)</span> fixed, only the component in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_{j}\)</span> direction remains:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\langle \mathbf{r}_{j} \rangle_{\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}_{2}, \ldots, \mathbf{r}_{j-1}\quad {\rm fixed}}=\cos \theta \mathbf{r}_{j-1}\]</span></p>
<p>For the calculation of <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle R^{2}\right\rangle\)</span> we also need <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle\mathbf{r}_{j} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{k}\right\rangle\)</span>, which we obtain by multiplying both sides with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_{k}\)</span> and taking the average: <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle r_{j} \mathbf{x}_{k}\right\rangle=\cos \theta\left\langle r_{j-1} \mathbf{x}_{k}\right\rangle=\cos ^{2} \theta\left\langle r_{j-2} \mathbf{\Sigma}_{k}\right\rangle=\ldots=\left(\cos ^{|j-k|} \theta\right)\left\langle r_{k}{\mathbf{x_{k}}}\right\rangle=\left(\cos ^{|j-k|} \theta\right) b_{0}^{2}\)</span>$</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\cos \theta&lt;1\)</span>, correlations between <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_{j}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_{k}\)</span> decrease with increasing distance <span class="math inline">\(|j-k|\)</span> between the links and the orientations of distant links become uncorrelated.</p>
<p>The end-to-end distance <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle R^{2}\right\rangle\)</span> of a freely-rotating chain is hence <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\left\langle R^{2}\right\rangle &amp; =\sum_{j=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N}\left\langle\mathbf{r}_{j} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{k}\right\rangle=b_{0}^{2} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N}\left(\cos ^{(j-k \mid} \theta\right)=N b_{0}^{2}+2 b_{0}^{2} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{j-1} \cos ^{(j-k)} \theta \\
&amp; =N b_{0}^{2}+2 b_{0}^{2} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \cos ^{j} \theta \sum_{k=1}^{j-1} \cos ^{-k} \theta
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>where we used the same argument as above to deal with <span class="math inline">\(|j-k|\)</span>. To calculate these two sums we consider the geometric progression:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
&amp; S=\sum_{m=1}^{M} x^{m}=x+x^{2}+\ldots .+x^{M} \quad \therefore x S=x^{2}+x^{3}+\ldots .+x^{M+1} \quad \therefore S-x S=x-x^{M+1} \\
&amp; \therefore S=\frac{x-x^{M+1}}{1-x}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>With the help of this formula we get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\left\langle R^{2}\right\rangle &amp; =N b_{0}^{2}+2 b_{0}^{2} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \cos ^{j} \theta \frac{\frac{1}{\cos \theta}-\frac{1}{\cos ^{j} \theta}}{1-\frac{1}{\cos \theta}}=N b_{0}^{2}+\frac{2 b_{0}^{2}}{\cos \theta-1}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{N} \cos ^{j} \theta-\sum_{j=1}^{N} \cos \theta\right) \\
&amp; =N b_{0}^{2}+\frac{2 b_{0}^{2}}{\cos \theta-1}\left(\frac{\cos \theta-\cos ^{N+1} \theta}{1-\cos \theta}-N \cos \theta\right)
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>For large N this can be simplified</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left\langle R^{2}\right\rangle \approx N b_{0}^{2}+\frac{2 b_{0}^{2}}{1-\cos \theta} N \cos \theta=N b_{0}^{2}\left(\frac{1+\cos \theta}{1-\cos \theta}\right)=C N b_{0}^{2}\]</span></p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">\(C=(1+\cos \theta) /(1-\cos \theta)\)</span>.</p>
<p>To get a better idea of the effect of a fixed angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, i.e.&nbsp;going from a freely-jointed to a freely-rotating chain, we look at a few special (but not necessarily very realistic) cases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\theta \rightarrow 0 \Rightarrow \cos \theta \rightarrow 1-\frac{\theta^{2}}{2} \Rightarrow C=\frac{2-\theta^{2} / 2}{\theta^{2} / 2} \approx \frac{4}{\theta^{2}} \quad\left(\mathrm{C} \approx 500\right.\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\left.\theta=5^{0}\right)\)</span></li>
</ol>
<div style="border: 2px solid blue; padding: 1em; border-radius: 8px; background-color: transparent;">
<p><span class="math display">\[
\therefore\left\langle R^{2}\right\rangle \gg N b_{0}^{2}
\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>This corresponds to a nearly straight chain, i.e., a rigid rod. The end-to-end distance is much larger than that of a flexible chain with the same number of segments.</p>

<p>Again, we get <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle R^{2}\right\rangle \propto N\)</span>, which suggests that a long freely-rotating chain can be represented by an <em>effective</em> freely-jointed chain with <span class="math inline">\(N'\)</span> segments of length <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>This is another example of <strong>coarse-graining</strong>.</p>
</div></div><p>Real and effective chain must have the same actual length, i.e. <span class="math display">\[
N b_0 = N' b
\]</span> and the same end-to-end distance, <span class="math display">\[
C N b_0^2 = N' b^2.
\]</span> Solving these two equations gives <span class="math inline">\(b = C b_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N' = N / C\)</span>.</p>
<p>These constraints result in <span class="math inline">\(b=C b_{0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N^{\prime}=N / C\)</span>. This has important consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>All sufficiently long flexible chains have identical behaviour as regards their dimensions: the chemical details are hidden in <span class="math inline">\(N^{\prime}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b.\)</span></li>
<li>While individual monomer pairs are not totally flexible, groups of monomers are</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> represents the number of monomers over which the orientational correlation is lost</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the so called <strong>“Kuhn” statistical segment length</strong> and defines a related characteristic known as the “persistence length” <span class="math inline">\(l_{p}=b/2\)</span>, also calculated directly via the correlation of bond vectors along the chain: <span class="math display">\[
\langle \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_{i+n} \rangle = b_0^2 \, \langle \cos \theta \rangle^n = b_0^2 \, e^{-n b_0 / l_p}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> is the bond length, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle between consecutive bonds, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of bonds separating the two segments.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the freely-rotating chain, <span class="math display">\[
l_p = -\frac{b_0}{\ln \langle \cos \theta \rangle}
\]</span></p>
<p>For small angles, this simplifies to <span class="math inline">\(l_p \approx \frac{b_0}{1 - \langle \cos \theta \rangle}\)</span>.</p>

<p>The fact that two monomers <strong>cannot occupy</strong> the same space has consequences on different length scales.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a local length scale this prevents neighbouring monomers from coming too close together. This effect is taken into account in terms of a <strong>restricted bond-angles</strong>, which prevent them from overlaping.</li>
<li>Non-overlap, i.e.&nbsp;excluded volume, of <strong>distant monomers</strong> along the chain has also to be taken into account and can have surprisingly large effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>To estimate the importance of this effect, we consider the fraction of coil volume actually occupied by monomers:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\quad V_{N}=N V_{1} \sim N b^{3},\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{V}_{1}\)</span> is the volume of a monomer.</p>
<p>The overall volume occupied by the whole coil is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V_{\text {coil }}=\frac{4 \pi}{3}\langle R_{g}^{2}\rangle^{3 / 2} \sim \frac{4 \pi}{3} N^{3 / 2} b^{3}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\therefore \frac{V_{N}}{V_{\text {coil }}}=\frac{N b^{3}}{(4 \pi / 3) N^{3 / 2} b^{3}} \sim N^{-1 / 2}\]</span></p>
<p>This means that for <span class="math inline">\(N=10^{4}\)</span> monomers occupy only about <span class="math inline">\(1 \%\)</span> of the whole coil volume.</p>
<p>The overall chain size as estimated by the rafdius of gyration <span class="math inline">\(\langle R_{g}^{2}\rangle^{1 / 2}\)</span> is determined by the competition of two effects:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Entropy</strong> (and chain connectivity) favour a <strong>compact chain</strong> and avoid the more unlikely stretched configurations</li>
<li>Repulsive <strong>excluded volume</strong> interactions want to <strong>expand the chain</strong> to avoid overlap.</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on this balance we will estimate the effect of excluded volume in a very hand-waving way. (Due to a fortuitous cancellation of errors introduced by various approximations, the result is practically identical to more rigorous treatments, which are very involved.)</p>
<p>We consider the Helmholtz function of a single chain, which is regarded as an assembly of particles with constant volume <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NV}_{1}\)</span> at constant temperature T :</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
F=U-T S
\]</span></p>
<p>The entropy S is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S=k_{B} \ln (\text {number of configurations })
\]</span></p>
<p>where for a given end-to-end vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span> the number of configurations is expected to be proportional to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(\mathbf{R})=\left(\frac{3}{2 \pi&lt;R^{2}&gt;}\right)^{3 / 2} e^{-\frac{3 R^{2}}{2&lt;R^{2}&gt;}}
\]</span></p>
<p>and hence</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S \sim \frac{-3 k_{B} R^{2}}{2 N b^{2}}+\text { terms indep. of } \mathrm{R}
\]</span></p>
<p>The internal energy <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> includes the kinetic and potential energy. However, the kinetic energy is <em>independent of the configuration</em> and thus of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span> and we only have to consider the potential energy.</p>
<p>To estimate the potential energy, we disregard the connectivity of the chain and calculate the interaction energy of a ‘segment gas’ confined in a volume <span class="math inline">\(R^{3}\)</span>. The probability of a monomer to lie in this volume is given by the fraction of total coil volume occupied by monomers, which we estimated above to be <span class="math inline">\(N V_{1} / R^{3}\)</span></p>
<p>Thus the probability of monomer-monomer contacts is <span class="math inline">\(N^{2} V_{1} / R^{3} \sim N^{1 / 2}\)</span>. With an energy <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> of a monomer-monomer contact, the potential energy <span class="math inline">\(U \sim \varepsilon N^{2} V_{1} / R^{3}\)</span>. We thus obtain</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
F=\frac{\varepsilon N^{2} V_{1}}{R^{3}}+\frac{3 k_{B} T R^{2}}{2 N b^{2}}+\text { terms indep. of } \mathrm{R}
\]</span></p>
<p>which can be minimized with respect to <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(d F / d R=0\)</span>, yielding</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R^{5}=\frac{\varepsilon V_{1} b^{2}}{k_{B} T} N^{3} \sim \frac{\varepsilon}{k_{B} T} N^{3} b^{5}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \therefore R \sim N^{3 / 5} b\]</span></p>
<p>Simulations give a very similar scaling, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{R} \sim N^{0.588}\)</span>. The chain can no longer be modelled by a random walk, but has to be described by a <strong>self-avoiding random walk</strong>. The distribution of end-to-end distances is also not Gaussian.</p>
<p>Although the difference between an exponent of 0.5 (as is characteristic for the freely jointed and freely-rotating chains, i.e.&nbsp;a random walk) and 0.6 (excluded volume chain, i.e.&nbsp;self-avoiding random walk) seems small, it has a large effect at large N . For example, for <span class="math inline">\(N=10^{4}, R=N^{0.5} b=100 b\)</span>, while <span class="math inline">\(R=N^{0.6} b=251 b\)</span>, which corresponds to a swelling of the chain by a factor of 2.5.</p>

<p>So far we only considered monomer-monomer interactions, which we assumed to be purely repulsive, and neglected the influence of the solvent.</p>
<p>However, the type of solvent has a great effect on the polymer size. If there is a high affinity with the solvent (‘good solvent’) the polymer swells, while it will shrink in a ‘poor solvent’.</p>
<p>Solvent affinity refers to how strongly the solvent molecules interact with the polymer (or monomer) molecules compared to how they interact with themselves or with other monomers. Mathematically, this is captured by the interaction energy <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{sp}\)</span> (solvent-monomer), compared to the average of solvent-solvent (<span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{ss}\)</span>) and monomer-monomer (<span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{pp}\)</span>) interactions.</p>
<p>We consider a <strong>lattice model</strong>, where each lattice site has <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> nearest neighbours and there are <span class="math inline">\(N_{s}\)</span> solvent molecules and <span class="math inline">\(N_{p}\)</span> monomers, with <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{sp}}\)</span> solvent-monomer contacts.</p>
<p>The energies of interaction are</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{s s}\)</span> for the solvent-solvent</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{pp}}\)</span> for monomer-monomer</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{s p}\)</span> for solvent-monomer interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the energy of mixing <span class="math inline">\(\Delta U_{\operatorname{mix}}\)</span> is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Delta U_{\operatorname{mix}}=U-\left(U_{S}+U_{p}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>where energy of pure solvent is <span class="math display">\[U_{s}=\frac{z N_{s} \varepsilon_{s s}}{2}\]</span></p>
<p>and the energy of pure polymer is <span class="math display">\[U_{p}=\frac{z N_{p} \varepsilon_{p p}}{2}\]</span></p>
<!-- ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-28.jpg?height=484&width=489&top_left_y=295&top_left_x=1263) -->
<p>resulting in an energy of solution <span class="math display">\[U=N_{s p} \varepsilon_{s p}+\frac{\left(z N_{s}-N_{s p}\right) \varepsilon_{s s}}{2}+\frac{\left(z N_{p}-N_{s p}\right) \varepsilon_{p p}}{2}\]</span></p>
<p>Hence we obtain for the <strong>energy of mixing</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Delta U_{\mathrm{mix}}=N_{s p}\left[\varepsilon_{s p}-\frac{1}{2}\left(\varepsilon_{s s}+\varepsilon_{p p}\right)\right]
\]</span></p>
<p>which can be either positive or negative:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good solvent</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{s p}&lt;\frac{1}{2}\left(\varepsilon_{s s}+\varepsilon_{p p}\right) \quad \therefore \Delta \mathrm{U}_{\text {mix }}&lt;0\)</span></li>
</ul>
<!-- ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-28.jpg?height=304&width=458&top_left_y=913&top_left_x=1279) -->
<p>This is the case of a ‘good solvent’, because the monomers prefer to be near the solvent molecules. Excluded volume effects then expand the chain.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poor solvent</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{s p}&gt;\frac{1}{2}\left(\varepsilon_{s s}+\varepsilon_{p p}\right) \quad \therefore \Delta \mathrm{U}_{\text {mix }}&gt;0\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the case of a ‘poor solvent’, because the monomers prefer to be near to each other (and similarly for the solvent molecules). The attraction between the different monomers offset the excluded volume effect.</p>
<p>The importance of the attractions generally depends on temperature. At very high temperatures the coil is expanded and the solvent quality is good. In contrast, at very low temperatures, the solvent quality is poor, attraction dominates, the coil collapses and phase separation is observed. In between these two limits, there is a temperature, the so-called theta temperature <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, where the coil has ideal dimensions and the effects of excluded volume and attraction cancel each other. The solvent at <span class="math inline">\(T=\theta\)</span> is called a ‘theta solvent’. The stronger the attractions the higher <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> will be, while for weak attractions <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is low. A full treatment of the coil expansion is rather involved and has to take into account excluded volume, attractions, configurational entropy and entropy of mixing. You can read more about the theta condition in <span class="citation" data-cites="jones2002soft">Jones (<a href="#ref-jones2002soft" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Up to now we considered a single polymer in a very dilute solution. Now we increase the concentration in steps until we reach bulk polymers.</p>
<p>The most important regimes of concentration are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dilute regime</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-29.jpg?height=375&width=366&top_left_y=1206&top_left_x=288) -->
<p>The polymer coils are well-separated on average. Call <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> the concentration expressed as mass per unit volume, then it satisfies</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \dfrac{c}{M}N_A \times \dfrac{4\pi}{3}R_g^3\ll 1\]</span></p>
<!-- ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-29.jpg?height=478&width=803&top_left_y=1343&top_left_x=1009) -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Overlap concentration <span class="math inline">\(c*\)</span></strong> <!-- ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-29.jpg?height=375&width=375&top_left_y=1960&top_left_x=284) --></li>
</ul>
<p>Overlap occurs when the volume fraction of coils reaches unity and thus</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{c^{*}}{M} N_{A} \frac{4 \pi}{3} R_{g}^{3} \sim 1 \quad \therefore c^{*}=\frac{3 M}{4 \pi N_{A} R_{g}^{3}}
\]</span></p>
<p>using <span class="math inline">\(R g=&lt;R g^{2&gt;^{1 / 2}}=B M^{\nu}\)</span> gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
c^{*}=\frac{3}{4 \pi N_{A} B^{3}} M^{1-3 v}
\]</span></p>
<p>For example, polystyrene with <span class="math inline">\(M=10^{6} \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\)</span> in a good solvent ( <span class="math inline">\(v=0.6\)</span> ) and <span class="math inline">\(B=0.028 \mathrm{~nm}\left(\mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right)^{-0.6}\)</span> leads to <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{c}^{*}=0.29 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}=0.29 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}\)</span>. With the density of polystyrene <span class="math inline">\(\rho=1050 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}\)</span>, the volume fraction of monomers is <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{c}^{*} / \rho=0.28 \times 10^{-3} . \mathrm{c}^{*}\)</span> can be very small for large polymers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semi-dilute</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_01_27_a9af280ad9752fe3d0c0g-30.jpg?height=361&width=361&top_left_y=522&top_left_x=291) -->
<p>The concentration is larger than the overlap concentration <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{c}^{*}\)</span>, but still much smaller than the bulk density. The coils interpenetrate and entangle, but the solution is still mostly solvent</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concentrated</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In this case the concentration is very close to the bulk density and the polymer monomers occupy a significant fraction of the total volume.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bulk polymers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>bulk polymer</strong> refers to a polymeric material in which the polymer chains occupy a significant fraction of the total volume, with little or no solvent present. In this regime, the properties of the material are dominated by polymer-polymer interactions rather than polymer-solvent interactions. Bulk polymers can be amorphous, semi-crystalline, or crystalline, and their mechanical, thermal, and optical properties are determined by the arrangement and mobility of the polymer chains.</p>
<p>Bulk polymers are divided into two main classes, characterised by whether they are cross-linked or not. There are elastomers or rubbers with a low degree of cross-linking and thermosets with a high degree of cross-linking. We will investigate the behaviour of rubbers in the next chapter. The second class are thermoplastics, which are not cross-linked. Most everyday plastic products are thermoplastics. We will briefly discuss their behaviour upon cooling, which shows similarities to the behaviour of colloids. At high temperature the free energy is dominated by the entropic terms. The melt resembles a random assembly of mobile, intertwined, flexible coils with a density similar to the density of the corresponding monomer liquid. Upon cooling the potential energy takes over and the bonds are restricted in their rotation leading to configurations which are more straightened out. Below the melting temperature <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}\)</span>, a crystal is the lowest free energy state. Crystallisation, however, requires significant ordering of the initially random melt and is only possible if cooling occurs slow enough. If the melt is rapidly cooled below the glass transition temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_{g}\left(&lt;T_{m}\right)\)</span>, then instead of a crystal a glass is formed, which represents an amorphous metastable, but long-lived state. Although the polymers can still vibrate, they can no longer move. Solid thermoplastics are frequently a mixture of crystalline and amorphous structures.</p>
